# Workplan: Identify Python LiteLLM Cache Tests

## Task ID
TEST-CacheLite-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
To initiate the test conversion for LiteLLM Caching, we must first comprehensively identify all relevant Python test cases for LiteLLM caching from `dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py`.

## Proposed Implementation
- Access the Python DSPy repository.
- Navigate to `dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py`.
- List all test functions (e.g., methods starting with `test_`).
- For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding LiteLLM caching behavior.
- Compile the final list of Python test cases to be ported for LiteLLM Caching.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (`dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py`)
- Analysis documentation (this workplan and its outputs)
- Future TypeScript test file: `tests/caching/LiteLLMCache.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- Parent Epic: `../../docs/planning/workplans/TEST-CachingLitellmTests.md`
- `TEST-Framework` (for understanding test environment)
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate` (for general conversion guidelines)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Navigate to `dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions in this file.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases to be ported.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against `dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py` to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: How to organize the list of identified tests.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding interactions with temporary cache directories and fixtures in Python tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on `test_litellm_cache.py`.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task is the first step in the TDD process for LiteLLM Caching.
