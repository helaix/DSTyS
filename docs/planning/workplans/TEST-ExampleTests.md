# Epic Overview: Example Tests Conversion (TEST-ExampleTests)

## Task ID
TEST-ExampleTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the `Example` class to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. These tests will serve as the specification for the `Example` implementation and ensure feature parity with the Python version while leveraging TypeScript's type system and Effect's functional programming patterns.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
The process involves converting Python tests for the `Example` class to TypeScript, adapting them for TypeScript's static typing and Effect TS patterns for any operations that might involve validation or error handling (though `Example` itself is mostly a data container).
1.  Analyze Python `Example` tests to understand their scope and assertions.
2.  Re-implement these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3.  Adapt test logic for TypeScript's type system (e.g., how dynamic attributes are handled).
4.  Use Effect-based assertions if `Example` methods return `Effect` objects (e.g., for validation).
5.  Create necessary mocks or test utilities.
The converted tests will guide the `CORE-ExampleImplementation`.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Vitest testing framework
- TypeScript test files for `Example`
- Mocks for any dependencies of `Example` during testing (e.g., `Signature` for validation tests)
- Effect TS testing patterns

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (Vitest setup, Effect test utilities)
- TEST-ConversionTemplate (guidelines for test conversion)
- TEST-FieldTests & CORE-FieldImplementation (if `Example` interacts with `Field`)
- TEST-SignatureTests & CORE-SignatureImplementation (if `Example` interacts with `Signature`)

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-ExTests-01-IdentifyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-01-IdentifyTests.md) - Identify Python Example tests
- [TEST-ExTests-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure and patterns
- [TEST-ExTests-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TypeScript test files
- [TEST-ExTests-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TypeScript & Effect
- [TEST-ExTests-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mock implementations
- [TEST-ExTests-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify test coverage
- [TEST-ExTests-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExTests-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document test patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Test file organization and naming.
  - Test utility implementation details.
  - Mock implementation details.
  - TypeScript-specific test adaptations.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python test coverage.
  - Additional test cases not present in Python version.
  - Changes to the expected behavior of `Example` that impact tests.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How to handle Python's dynamic object creation and attribute access in TypeScript tests for `Example`.
- How to integrate Effect TS patterns for error handling in tests if `Example` methods become Effect-ful.
- How serialization and deserialization tests for `Example` should be adapted to TypeScript.

### Non-blocking
- Exact test organization can be refined.
- Test utility implementation details can be adjusted.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- May need to adapt some Python test patterns to TypeScript idioms.
- Initial test coverage might not be 100% identical if some Python-specific dynamic behaviors are not directly replicated.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The `Example` class is fundamental; its tests are critical for data handling integrity.
- Test conversion should focus on behavioral equivalence.
- These tests will build on patterns from `TEST-FieldTests` and `TEST-SignatureTests` if `Example` interacts with those.
