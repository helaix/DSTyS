# Workplan: Analyze GRPO Optimizer Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-TpGRPO-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of Python tests for `GRPO`, focusing on how dataset shuffling, reinforcement steps, and LM interactions are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test for `GRPO`.
- Document:
    - Setup of student/teacher modules, trainsets, metrics.
    - How dataset shuffling and sampling are tested.
    - How reinforcement learning steps (if explicitly tested) are simulated or asserted.
- Identify challenges for TypeScript conversion.

## Components Involved
- Python `GRPO` test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpGRPO-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python `GRPO` test:
    - [ ] Document core assertions.
    - [ ] Note setup of modules, data, and optimizer parameters.
    - [ ] Analyze mocking of LM interactions or reinforcement steps.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TS/Effect conversion.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python `GRPO` test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Complexity of the GRPO algorithm and its test simulations.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on core optimizer logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Understanding this is key for testing `GRPO` in DSTyS.
