# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for dspy.cache Tests

## Task ID
TEST-CliCache-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Identify and create necessary mock implementations or test utilities for `dspy.cache` tests. This primarily involves creating mock functions to be decorated by `@request_cache` and mock data for cache storage.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the converted `dspy.cache` tests from `TEST-CliCache-04-AdaptTests`.
- Create simple synchronous and asynchronous mock functions that can be decorated with the TypeScript equivalent of `@request_cache`. These functions should allow tracking of calls to verify caching behavior.
- Create mock request objects and response values for testing `cache.put()` and `cache.get()`.
- Helper functions for setting up and cleaning temporary disk cache directories (if not already covered by `TEST-CacheLite-05-CreateMocks` and reusable).
- Place mocks in `tests/utils/mocks/` or alongside `Cache.test.ts`.

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/Cache.test.ts`.
- `tests/utils/mocks/` (for shared mocks).
- Mock functions and data.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliCache-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests will drive the need for specific mock behaviors).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `mockSyncFunctionToCache(arg1: string, arg2: number)`:
    - Has a `callCount` property.
    - Returns a simple value based on args.
- [ ] Create `mockAsyncFunctionToCache(arg1: string, arg2: number): Promise<any>`:
    - Has a `callCount` property.
    - Returns a promise resolving to a simple value.
- [ ] Create sample request objects (dictionaries) and response values for direct cache testing.
- [ ] If not already created, implement temporary directory helpers for disk cache tests.
- [ ] Integrate these mocks and utilities into `Cache.test.ts`.

## Verification Steps
- Mocks and test utilities simplify `dspy.cache` test code.
- Mock functions allow accurate testing of the `@requestCache` decorator.
- Temporary directory utilities work correctly for disk cache tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details of mocks and utilities.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- The API of the TypeScript `@requestCache` decorator.

### Non-blocking
- Mocks can be refined as the actual `Cache` class is implemented.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial mock functions can be very simple.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Effective mocking is crucial for testing the caching decorator and direct cache operations.
