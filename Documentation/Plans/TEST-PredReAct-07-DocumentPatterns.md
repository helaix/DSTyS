# Workplan: Document ReAct Module Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredReAct-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `ReAct` module. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar agentic or tool-using modules.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `ReAct.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking LMs for thought/action generation, mock `Tool` instances with Zod schemas), common assertion patterns for trajectory content or final outputs, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing the iterative process and tool calls.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `ReAct` scenarios (e.g., successful tool use, tool errors, trajectory truncation) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/predict/ReAct.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredReAct-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `ReAct` module tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `ReAct.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock LMs to return specific thoughts, tool names, and arguments.
    - How to create and use mock `Tool` instances with Zod schemas for testing.
    - Patterns for asserting the content of the `trajectory` (thoughts, actions, observations).
    - Testing different configurations (e.g., `max_iters`).
    - How to test error handling from tool executions within the `ReAct` loop.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `ReAct` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `ReAct` module testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test complex agentic modules.
