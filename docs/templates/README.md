# DSTy Project Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for the DSTy project development workflow.

## Available Templates

### 1. [Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template](./product_requirements_document_template.md)

The PRD template is designed to help define what you're building and why. It establishes clear requirements and success metrics for features and components of the DSTy project.

#### How to Use the PRD Template

1. **Start with stream-of-consciousness recording**:
   - Record your thoughts about the product vision
   - Don't worry about structure at this stage
   - Focus on capturing what you're trying to build and why

2. **Transcribe and organize**:
   - Convert your recording into text
   - Begin organizing thoughts into the template sections
   - Identify areas that need more development

3. **Refine into structured document**:
   - Fill in all sections of the template
   - Ensure all key components are addressed
   - Review for clarity and completeness

4. **Review with stakeholders**:
   - Share the draft with key stakeholders
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any conflicting requirements

5. **Finalize the document**:
   - Update based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

## Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive documentation:

1. **Document Information**: Version tracking and ownership
2. **Key Sections**: Specific to each template type
3. **Appendices**: Supporting information, glossary, and revision history
4. **Usage Notes**: Guidelines on effectively using the template
