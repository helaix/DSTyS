# Workplan: Analyze Streaming Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-Stream-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for streaming. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how async iterators, stream listeners, and status messages are handled and asserted.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for streaming from `TEST-Stream-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking streamed chunks, verifying `StreamListener` behavior, asserting status messages, testing with different adapters like Chat and JSON).
- Identify how Python's async features (`async for`, `async def`) are used and how these translate to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.
- Note any dependencies on other DSPy components (like `Predict`, `LM`, `Tool`, Adapters).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic, especially for mocking streaming LM responses.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python streaming test cases from `dspy/tests/streaming/test_streaming.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Stream-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for streaming).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python streaming test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made (e.g., content of streamed chunks, order of status messages).
    - [ ] Note how streaming programs and listeners are set up.
    - [ ] Identify how streaming LM responses are mocked.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific async features.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `streamify`, `StreamListener`, and status messages.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used in the Python tests.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect `Stream`.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python streaming tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how different adapters (Chat vs. JSON) affect streaming behavior and testing.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to core streaming functionalities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and any necessary helper utilities for streaming.
