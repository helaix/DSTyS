# Workplan: Verify PgVectorRM Integration Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-RetPgVecI-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `PgVectorRM.ts` is implemented and its integration tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves adequate code coverage for this retriever model.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `PgVectorRM` implementation and integration tests pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for `source/retrieve/PgVectorRM.ts`.
    - Identify untested parts of the `PgVectorRM` logic (e.g., specific SQL query construction paths, error handling for DB operations).
    - Write additional integration tests or unit tests (with mocked DB client) to cover gaps.

## Components Involved
- `source/retrieve/PgVectorRM.ts`.
- `tests/retrieve/PgVectorRM.integration.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-RetrievePgVectorRMImplementation` (Conceptual).
- All `PgVectorRM` integration tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `PgVectorRM.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/retrieve/PgVectorRM.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 80-85% for DB-heavy code), add tests.
    - Consider adding unit tests with a mocked PostgreSQL client to cover specific logic branches without needing full DB setup for every case.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows good coverage for `PgVectorRM.ts`.
- Critical paths, including query construction and result parsing, are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of gaps if some DB error states are hard to simulate.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Difficulty in simulating all possible database error conditions.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus coverage on the core query logic and interaction with the DB client.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures the `PgVectorRM` is robust in its database interactions.
