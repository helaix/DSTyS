# DSTy Project Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for the DSTy project development workflow.

## Available Templates

### 1. [Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template](./product_requirements_document_template.md)

The PRD template is designed to help define what you're building and why. It establishes clear requirements and success metrics for features and components of the DSTy project.

#### How to Use the PRD Template

1. **Start with stream-of-consciousness recording**:
   - Record your thoughts about the product vision
   - Don't worry about structure at this stage
   - Focus on capturing what you're trying to build and why

2. **Transcribe and organize**:
   - Convert your recording into text
   - Begin organizing thoughts into the template sections
   - Identify areas that need more development

3. **Refine into structured document**:
   - Fill in all sections of the template
   - Ensure all key components are addressed
   - Review for clarity and completeness

4. **Review with stakeholders**:
   - Share the draft with key stakeholders
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any conflicting requirements

5. **Finalize the document**:
   - Update based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

### 2. [Architecture Document Template](./architecture_document_template.md)

The Architecture Document template is designed to define how you'll build the product, establishing the technical foundation and implementation approach for the DSTy project.

#### How to Use the Architecture Document Template

1. **Review the PRD**:
   - Understand the requirements and constraints
   - Identify key functional and non-functional requirements
   - Note any technical constraints or preferences

2. **Evaluate technology options**:
   - Research suitable technologies for the project
   - Compare alternatives based on project needs
   - Justify your technology choices

3. **Draft architecture with diagrams**:
   - Create high-level design with components and interactions
   - Use diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) to illustrate the architecture
   - Ensure all major components are represented

4. **Define API contracts and data models**:
   - Document API endpoints, methods, and data structures
   - Create entity relationship diagrams
   - Define data schemas and relationships

5. **Document non-functional requirements implementation**:
   - Address performance considerations
   - Include security measures
   - Plan for scalability and reliability
   - Outline maintainability approaches

6. **Outline testing strategy**:
   - Define test-driven development approach
   - Include unit, integration, and system testing plans
   - Document test environments and data management

7. **Review with technical stakeholders**:
   - Share the draft with technical team members
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any technical concerns or conflicts

8. **Finalize the document**:
   - Update based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

### 3. [Project Overview Template](./project_overview_template.md)

The Project Overview template is designed to break down the project into implementable chunks, providing a clear roadmap for development.

#### How to Use the Project Overview Template

1. **Review existing documentation**:
   - Analyze the PRD, Architecture Document, and UX/UI Plan
   - Understand project requirements and technical approach
   - Identify key components and dependencies

2. **Identify major components**:
   - Break down the system into functional components
   - Define component interfaces and dependencies
   - Create component diagrams to visualize relationships

3. **Define implementation phases**:
   - Organize work into logical sequential phases
   - Establish clear goals and deliverables for each phase
   - Define exit criteria for phase completion

4. **Create implementation chunks**:
   - Break down components into manageable units of work
   - Estimate effort for each chunk
   - Define acceptance criteria for each chunk

5. **Assess risks and develop mitigation strategies**:
   - Identify technical, schedule, and resource risks
   - Evaluate likelihood and impact of each risk
   - Develop strategies to mitigate high-priority risks

6. **Create implementation roadmap**:
   - Develop timeline with key milestones
   - Allocate resources across phases
   - Establish dependencies between chunks

7. **Review with stakeholders**:
   - Share the document with technical and product stakeholders
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Finalize the implementation plan

### 4. [Workplan Template](./workplan_template.md)

The Workplan template is designed to create detailed implementation instructions for each chunk identified in the Project Overview, providing clear guidance for developers.

#### How to Use the Workplan Template

1. **Select chunks from Project Overview**:
   - Identify specific implementation chunks from the Project Overview
   - Understand how the chunk fits into the overall project
   - Review dependencies and prerequisites

2. **Break down the chunk into detailed tasks**:
   - Create specific, actionable tasks
   - Estimate effort for each task
   - Define task dependencies and sequence
   - Establish milestones for tracking progress

3. **Define technical specifications for each task**:
   - Provide detailed design information
   - Include diagrams, data models, and API specifications
   - Document technical constraints and dependencies
   - Specify how the implementation fits into the overall architecture

4. **Develop testing strategies**:
   - Define the testing approach
   - Create specific test cases
   - Specify test environments and data
   - Include performance testing requirements

5. **Create implementation guidance**:
   - Document best practices to follow
   - Provide code examples and references
   - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
   - Include security and performance considerations

6. **Define review criteria**:
   - Establish clear criteria for implementation review
   - Define code quality standards
   - Specify documentation requirements
   - Create testing verification checklist

7. **Review with technical stakeholders**:
   - Share the workplan with technical team members
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Finalize the implementation plan

## Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive documentation:

1. **Document Information**: Version tracking and ownership
2. **Key Sections**: Specific to each template type
3. **Appendices**: Supporting information, glossary, and revision history
4. **Usage Notes**: Guidelines on effectively using the template
