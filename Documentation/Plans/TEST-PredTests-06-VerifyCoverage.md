# Workplan: Verify Prediction Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-PredTests-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `Prediction.ts` is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves target code coverage for `Prediction` and `Completions` classes.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `CORE-PredictionImplementation` is complete and `TEST-PredTests` pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for `source/primitives/Prediction.ts`.
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests, aiming for >90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/primitives/Prediction.ts`.
- `tests/primitives/Prediction.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-PredImpl-07-TestCompatibility` (All `Prediction` tests passing).
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Prediction.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/primitives/Prediction.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 90%):
    - Identify uncovered lines/branches.
    - Add new tests in `Prediction.test.ts`.
    - Re-run coverage.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows >90% for `Prediction.ts`.
- All critical paths in `Prediction` are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
High coverage for `Prediction` is vital.
