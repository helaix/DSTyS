# Workplan: Analyze Retry Logic Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredRetry-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for retry logic. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for retry logic from `TEST-PredRetry-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking number of LM calls, verifying final outcome after retries, testing specific error conditions that trigger retries).
- Identify how Python's features (like `pytest.raises` or mocking side effects) are used.
- Note dependencies on `Predict`, `LM`, and error types.
- Identify complex setup for simulating failures.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python retry logic test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredRetry-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python retry test:
    - [ ] Document core assertions.
    - [ ] Note how LMs are mocked to simulate failures and eventual success.
    - [ ] Identify Python-specific error handling or mocking techniques.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for retry logic.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TypeScript/Effect conversion (e.g., testing `Effect.retry` with `Schedule`).

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python retry test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How different retry schedules (e.g., exponential backoff) are tested.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on core retry behavior.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis guides the TypeScript test implementation for retry logic.
