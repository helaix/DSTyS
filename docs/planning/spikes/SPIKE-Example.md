# SPIKE-EffectTS-Streaming

## Investigation Objective

To evaluate and determine the most effective approach for implementing streaming responses with Effect TS in the DSTyS project, with particular focus on handling backpressure, cancellation, and integration with the existing architecture.

## Investigation Approach

1. Research available streaming patterns in Effect TS
2. Implement small prototypes for each identified approach
3. Benchmark performance characteristics of each approach
4. Evaluate developer experience and code maintainability
5. Test integration with existing DSTyS components
6. Document findings and recommendations

## Areas of Focus

- Stream creation and consumption patterns in Effect TS
- Backpressure handling mechanisms
- Cancellation and resource cleanup
- Error handling in streaming contexts
- Integration with HTTP server components
- Performance characteristics under various loads
- Memory usage patterns

## Evaluation Criteria

The investigation will be considered successful if it:
- Identifies at least 2-3 viable approaches for streaming implementation
- Provides concrete performance metrics for each approach
- Demonstrates working prototypes for each approach
- Offers clear recommendations with rationale
- Addresses all key concerns (backpressure, cancellation, etc.)
- Provides implementation guidance for the recommended approach

## Documentation Requirements

The spike should document:
- Description of each approach investigated
- Code samples for each approach
- Performance benchmarks and methodology
- Pros and cons of each approach
- Integration considerations with existing architecture
- Recommended approach with detailed rationale
- Implementation guidance for the recommended approach

## Review Process

The spike findings will be reviewed by:
1. Technical lead to validate technical approach
2. Team members who will implement streaming functionality
3. Stakeholders with performance or reliability concerns

The review will focus on:
- Validity of the performance benchmarks
- Completeness of the investigation
- Alignment of recommendations with project goals
- Clarity of implementation guidance

## Time Box

This spike is time-boxed to 3 days.
