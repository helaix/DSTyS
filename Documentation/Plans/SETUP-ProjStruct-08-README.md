# Workplan: Create README.md with Project Overview

## Task ID
SETUP-ProjStruct-08-README

## Problem Statement
Create the main `README.md` file for the DSTyS project. This file is the primary entry point for anyone visiting the repository and should provide a concise overview, setup instructions, and links to further documentation.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create `README.md` in the project root.
- Content should include:
    - **Project Title and Logo (if available)**.
    - **Brief Description**: What DSTyS is, its core purpose (DSPy in TypeScript with Effect).
    - **Key Features/Goals**: Highlight main selling points (type safety, functional programming, DSPy parity).
    - **Status Badge(s)** (Optional, for CI, coverage, npm version - can be added later).
    - **Table of Contents** (Optional, if README becomes long).
    - **Getting Started**:
        - Prerequisites (Node.js version).
        - Installation instructions (`npm install dstys` or from source).
        - Basic usage example (a very simple "hello world" style DSPy program).
    - **Development**:
        - Instructions for cloning the repo.
        - Setting up the development environment (`npm install`).
        - Running tests (`npm test`).
        - Building the library (`npm run build`).
    - **Documentation**: Link to the main documentation site/directory (e.g., `docs/`).
    - **Contributing**: Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be created).
    - **License**: Mention the project license (e.g., MIT) and link to `LICENSE` file.
- Keep the README concise and focused on essential information, deferring details to the `docs/` directory.
- Testing: Review the README for clarity, accuracy, and completeness of essential information.

## Components Involved
- `README.md` (root file)

## Dependencies
- Decisions on project name, license.
- Basic installation and build scripts defined in `package.json` (`SETUP-ProjStruct-06-PackageJson`).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `README.md` in the project root.
- [ ] Add Project Title.
- [ ] Write a concise project description.
- [ ] List 2-3 Key Features/Goals.
- [ ] Add "Getting Started" section:
    - Prerequisites.
    - Installation command.
    - A minimal "Hello DSPy-TS" code example.
- [ ] Add "Development" section:
    - Clone command.
    - Dev environment setup command.
    - Test and build commands.
- [ ] Add a link to the main documentation (e.g., "For more detailed documentation, see [./docs](./docs/)").
- [ ] Add a placeholder for "Contributing" (e.g., "See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.").
- [ ] Add a "License" section mentioning the chosen license.
- [ ] Review and refine for clarity and conciseness.

## Verification Steps
- `README.md` is well-formatted Markdown.
- All instructions (installation, build, test) are accurate and work.
- Links to other documents/sections are correct.
- The README provides a good first impression and essential information for new users/contributors.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific wording and formatting of sections.
- User Input: The "Hello DSPy-TS" example to showcase.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- The exact "Hello DSPy-TS" example can be refined once core primitives are available.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- The initial README can be relatively simple, with more badges, ToC, and detailed sections added as the project matures.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
A good README is crucial for project adoption and contributor onboarding.
