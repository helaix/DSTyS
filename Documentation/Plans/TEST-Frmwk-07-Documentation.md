# Workplan: Document Testing Framework and Practices

## Task ID
TEST-Frmwk-07-Documentation

## Problem Statement
Create documentation for the DSTyS testing framework, utilities, and best practices. This will help developers write consistent, effective tests and understand how to test different parts of the library, especially Effect-based code.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create a new document or section within the project's `docs/` directory (e.g., `docs/development/testing.md`).
- Document:
    - How to run tests (unit, integration, coverage).
    - The structure of test files and naming conventions.
    - How to test Effect-based code (using chosen patterns from `TEST-Frmwk-02-EffectIntegration`).
    - How to use mocking utilities (from `TEST-Frmwk-03-MockingUtils`).
    - How to use common test utilities (from `TEST-Frmwk-05-CreateTestUtils`).
    - Guidelines for writing good tests (e.g., Arrange-Act-Assert, testing edge cases).
    - Information on code coverage and how to interpret reports.
- Include code examples for common testing scenarios.
- Link to Vitest and Effect testing documentation for further reference.

## Components Involved
- Project documentation files (e.g., `docs/development/testing.md`).

## Dependencies
- All preceding `TEST-Frmwk-*` tasks, as they define the content to be documented.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `docs/development/testing.md` (or similar).
- [ ] Add sections for:
    - Running Tests (scripts from `package.json`).
    - Test File Structure and Naming.
    - Testing Effectful Code (with examples).
    - Mocking Dependencies (with examples).
    - Using Test Utilities (with examples).
    - Code Coverage.
    - Best Practices.
- [ ] Write clear explanations and provide code snippets for each section.
- [ ] Link to external Vitest/Effect documentation where appropriate.
- [ ] Review documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

## Verification Steps
- The testing documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.
- Developers can use the documentation to effectively write tests for DSTyS components.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Structure and wording of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- The documentation will evolve as new testing patterns or utilities are added.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Start with essential information and expand details as the project matures.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good testing documentation is vital for maintaining a high-quality test suite and onboarding new contributors.
