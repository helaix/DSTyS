# Workplan: Verify Predict Module Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-PredMod-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `Predict.ts` is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves target code coverage for the `Predict` module.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `CORE-PredictModuleImplementation` is complete and `TEST-PredMod` tests pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for `source/predict/Predict.ts`.
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests, aiming for >90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/predict/Predict.ts`.
- `tests/predict/Predict.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-PredictModuleImplementation` (Conceptual implementation task).
- All `Predict` tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Predict.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/predict/Predict.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 90%), add new tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows >90% for `Predict.ts`.
- All critical paths in `Predict` are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex adapter interactions or error handling.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
High coverage for `Predict` is vital.
