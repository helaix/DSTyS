# Workplan: Create TypeScript Test Files for Databricks Client

## Task ID
TEST-CliDBX-03-CreateTSFiles

## Problem Statement
Create the basic structure for TypeScript test files for the Databricks Client component, using Vitest. This involves setting up `describe` blocks and placeholder `test` cases based on the analysis of Python tests.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create a new test file, e.g., `tests/clients/DatabricksClient.test.ts`.
- Based on the analysis from `TEST-CliDBX-02-AnalyzeStructure`, create `describe` blocks for different aspects of Databricks Client functionality (e.g., "Finetuning Job Creation", "Model Deployment", "API Interaction").
- Within these blocks, create placeholder `test` (or `it`) functions for each corresponding Python test case. Name them descriptively.
- Import necessary Vitest functions (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`).

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/DatabricksClient.test.ts` (new file).
- Vitest testing framework.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliDBX-02-AnalyzeStructure` (Analysis of Python test structure).
- `TEST-Framework` (Vitest setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `tests/clients/DatabricksClient.test.ts`.
- [ ] Add top-level `describe('DatabricksClient', () => { /* ... */ });`.
- [ ] Create nested `describe` blocks for logical groupings of Databricks Client tests.
- [ ] For each identified Python Databricks Client test, create a corresponding `it('should ...', () => { expect(true).toBe(false); // Placeholder });` in the appropriate `describe` block.
- [ ] Include `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks for managing mock states or SDK clients.
- [ ] Ensure all placeholder tests initially fail or are skipped using `it.skip` or `it.todo`.

## Verification Steps
- The `DatabricksClient.test.ts` file exists and is correctly structured.
- Running `npm run test` (or equivalent) should show these new tests, likely failing or skipped.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Naming of `describe` and `it` blocks.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Exact grouping of tests can be refined later.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Placeholder tests are sufficient at this stage.

## Status
Not Started
