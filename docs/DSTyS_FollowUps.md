# DSTyS Project Follow-Up Actions and Research Items

This document consolidates outstanding questions, research items, and recommendations from the project critique that require further action, investigation, or dedicated documentation efforts.

## General
- **Developer Experience (DX) as a Key Deliverable**: Explicitly define DX goals for DSTyS users (e.g., type safety, error messages, debuggability) and ensure architectural choices and API designs support these.
- **Knowledge Sharing and Upskilling**: Plan for developer onboarding, knowledge sharing (e.g., internal workshops on Effect patterns for DSTyS), or pair programming for complex modules.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD) Follow-Ups

1.  **API and Behavior Mapping Document**:
    *   **Action**: Create a detailed mapping document. For each Python DSPy 2.6.x component:
        *   Define the target TypeScript API signature.
        *   Describe the expected behavior, including edge cases.
        *   Document any planned deviations from the Python API due to TypeScript/Effect idioms, with clear justifications.
        *   Specify how parity will be verified (e.g., specific tests, behavioral equivalence criteria).
    *   **Impact**: Crucial for guiding implementation and testing, clarifies "feature parity".

2.  **Process for Upstream DSPy Evolution**:
    *   **Action**: Define a concrete process for tracking and incorporating changes from future Python DSPy versions (beyond 2.6.x).
        *   e.g., Quarterly reviews of DSPy releases.
        *   Criteria for deciding which new DSPy features to port.
        *   How DSTyS versioning will relate to DSPy versioning.

## Architecture Document Follow-Ups

1.  **Detailed Component Interaction & Data Flow Diagrams**:
    *   **Action**: Create sequence diagrams or more granular component diagrams for 2-3 core use cases (e.g., a `Predict` call, a `BootstrapFewShot` compilation step). Show how `Signature`, `Module`, `Predictor`, `LM`, and `Effect` interact.
    *   **Impact**: Provides deeper understanding of system dynamics.

2.  **Architectural Decision Record (ADR) on "Translating Pythonic Dynamism"**:
    *   **Action**: Create an ADR proposing concrete TypeScript/Effect patterns for:
        *   `Signature` creation and manipulation (e.g., using builder patterns, advanced generics, or immutable transformations).
        *   `Predictor` state (like `demos`) management (e.g., immutable state updates, context-passing, or dedicated stateful services managed by Effect).
        *   How modules like `ChainOfThought` will modify or extend signatures in a type-safe way.
    *   **Impact**: Addresses a critical technical challenge.

3.  **Serialization/Deserialization Strategy**:
    *   **Action**: Outline the approach for serializing and deserializing `Module` states, including `Predictor` configurations and compiled optimizer states. Consider using Zod schemas for validation, potentially integrated with `Effect.Schema`.
    *   **Impact**: Essential for `save`/`load` functionality.

4.  **Extensibility Design**:
    *   **Action**: Define clear interfaces (perhaps using `Effect.Service` tags) for extension points (new LM providers, retrieval models, optimizers) and outline expected implementation patterns.
    *   **Impact**: Facilitates community contributions and custom extensions.

## Project Overview Follow-Ups

1.  **Re-evaluate Effort Estimates and Timelines**:
    *   **Action**: With the team, re-evaluate person-day estimates for core components, factoring in research/design spikes for Python-to-TypeScript translations, learning curves for Effect TS, and the overhead of writing idiomatic, well-tested Effect code. Consider adding a "Complexity/Uncertainty Multiplier".
    *   **Impact**: Improves project predictability.

2.  **Identify and Visualize Critical Path**:
    *   **Action**: Explicitly highlight the critical path in the Gantt chart or a separate section.
    *   **Impact**: Helps in prioritizing and managing risks.

3.  **Policy for Upstream DSPy Changes (During Development)**:
    *   **Action**: Decide and document the policy: Will DSTyS development pause to assess and potentially incorporate breaking/major changes from upstream DSPy (beyond 2.6.x), or will it strictly stick to 2.6.x for v1.0 and plan a subsequent "catch-up" release?
    *   **Impact**: Clarifies scope management during development.

## Work Plans Follow-Ups

1.  **Resolution Path for "Blocking Questions"**:
    *   **Action**: The Project Overview or a master project planning document should specify how blocking questions (listed in individual work plans) are escalated and resolved (e.g., dedicated research spikes, team design sessions, ADR creation).
    *   **Impact**: Ensures timely resolution of impediments.

2.  **Cross-Cutting Concerns Work Plans/ADRs**:
    *   **Action**: Create specific, early work plans or ADRs for establishing cross-cutting concerns like logging, telemetry, global configuration (`dspy.settings`), and advanced Effect TS patterns (DI via Layers, error hierarchies).
    *   **Impact**: Ensures consistency across components.

3.  **Periodic Review Mechanism for Work Plans**:
    *   **Action**: The Project Overview should mention a periodic review mechanism (e.g., at the end of each phase) to update subsequent work plans based on lessons learned from earlier implementations.
    *   **Impact**: Improves accuracy of later-phase planning.

## Templates Follow-Ups
- Ensure all templates are updated to reflect the new sections and considerations added to the main documents.
- Specifically, the `workplan_template.md` should prompt for referencing the "API and Behavior Mapping Document" and linking blocking questions to the defined resolution process.
