# Workplan: Document JSON Adapter Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-AdJson-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `JSONAdapter` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar adapter components, especially those dealing with structured data and Zod/Pydantic-like schemas.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `JSONAdapter.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock Signatures with Zod fields, mock LMs simulating structured output), common assertion patterns for JSON structures, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing adapter logic.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how `JSONAdapter`'s formatting, parsing, and structured output handling were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/adapters/JSONAdapter.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-AdJson-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `JSONAdapter` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `JSONAdapter.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How `JSONAdapter.format` is tested with Signatures using Zod fields.
    - How `JSONAdapter.parse` is tested with various JSON response strings (valid, invalid).
    - How testing is done for LMs supporting structured JSON output vs. those that don't (fallback).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `JSONAdapter` tests (e.g., mock Zod schemas).
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `JSONAdapter` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers to testing practices for structured data adapters.
