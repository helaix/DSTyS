# Epic Overview: Tool Implementation (CORE-ToolImplementation)

## Task ID
CORE-ToolImplementation (Epic)

## Problem Statement
The Tool class is an important component of the DSTyS library, enabling integration with external tools and functions (e.g., calculators, search engines, APIs). We need to implement the Tool class with TypeScript's type system, integrate it with Module concepts (as Tools can be seen as simple modules), use Effect for error handling during tool execution, and ensure it supports dynamic invocation by agentic modules like ReAct. The implementation must pass all the tests created in the TEST-ToolTests task.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will implement the `Tool` class in TypeScript. Key aspects include:
- Defining the `Tool` class structure, which will wrap a user-provided function.
- Automatically inferring or allowing explicit definition of the tool's name, description, and input arguments (name, type, description for each argument). This metadata is crucial for LMs to decide when and how to use the tool.
- Implementing an execution method (e.g., `tool.execute(args)`) that calls the wrapped function with provided arguments, handles type validation for arguments, and manages errors using Effect.
- Supporting both synchronous and asynchronous tool functions.
- Implementing serialization/deserialization for tool definitions if tools are to be part of saved module state (less common for tools themselves, more for modules that *use* tools).

The implementation will follow these principles:
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for defining tool argument schemas (possibly using Zod or Pydantic-like models).
- Use Effect for handling errors during tool execution (e.g., function throws an error, argument validation fails).
- Maintain conceptual compatibility with Python DSPy's `Tool` API.
- Provide a type-safe and developer-friendly API for defining and using tools.

The `Tool` implementation will enable modules like `ReAct` to dynamically invoke external functionalities.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- `Tool` class
- Argument schema inference/definition (potentially using Zod or reflection)
- Tool execution logic (sync and async)
- Effect integration for error handling

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-ToolTests (must be completed first)
- CORE-FieldImplementation (for argument definitions, if aligned)
- CORE-SignatureImplementation (if tool I/O is modeled as a signature)
- CORE-ModuleImplementation (if Tool itself is a Module or used by Modules)
- Effect library
- Zod library (for argument validation)

## Granular Workplans
- [CORE-ToolImpl-01-ClassDef](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-01-ClassDef.md) - Create Tool class definition
- [CORE-ToolImpl-02-Execution](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-02-Execution.md) - Implement tool execution logic (sync/async)
- [CORE-ToolImpl-03-ArgParsing](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-03-ArgParsing.md) - Implement argument parsing and schema generation
- [CORE-ToolImpl-04-ErrorHandling](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-04-ErrorHandling.md) - Implement error handling for tool execution
- [CORE-ToolImpl-05-EffectIntegration](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-05-EffectIntegration.md) - Deepen Effect integration for execution flow
- [CORE-ToolImpl-06-Serialization](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-06-Serialization.md) - Implement serialization (if applicable for tool definitions)
- [CORE-ToolImpl-07-TestCompatibility](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-ToolImpl-07-TestCompatibility.md) - Ensure test compatibility

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Internal implementation of argument parsing and validation.
  - TypeScript-specific adaptations for wrapping user functions.
  - Error handling details for tool execution failures.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python DSPy's `Tool` API.
  - Strategy for argument schema generation/inference if significantly different from Python's inspect-based approach.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How to best infer argument schemas (names, types, descriptions) from TypeScript functions, especially for complex types or if decorators are not heavily used. Runtime type information in JS/TS is limited.
- Handling asynchronous tool functions seamlessly.

### Non-blocking
- The exact format for representing tool argument schemas internally.
- Support for advanced features like dynamic tool registration/discovery if not part of core Python DSPy `Tool`.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- May require more explicit type/schema definitions for tool arguments in TypeScript compared to Python's dynamic introspection, to ensure type safety.
- Initial implementation might focus on tools with simple primitive arguments, with complex object/Pydantic model arguments handled iteratively.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The `Tool` class is crucial for enabling agentic behaviors and interactions with external systems.
- Type safety in argument passing and robust error handling during execution are key priorities.
- Effect TS integration will manage the asynchronous and fallible nature of tool calls.
