# Workplan: Document ProgramOfThought Module Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredPoT-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `ProgramOfThought` module. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar code-generating or iterative modules.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `ProgramOfThought.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking LMs for code generation, mock code interpreters), common assertion patterns for generated code or execution results, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing the iterative process.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `ProgramOfThought` scenarios (e.g., successful execution, code errors, max iterations) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/predict/ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredPoT-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `ProgramOfThought` module tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `ProgramOfThought.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock LMs to return specific code snippets.
    - How to use the mock code interpreter to simulate execution results and errors.
    - Patterns for asserting the final output and intermediate states (if applicable).
    - Testing different configurations (e.g., `max_iters`).
    - How to test error handling within the `ProgramOfThought` loop.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `ProgramOfThought` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `ProgramOfThought` module testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test complex generative and iterative modules.
