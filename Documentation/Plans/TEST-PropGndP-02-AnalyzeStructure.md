# Workplan: Analyze GroundedProposer Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PropGndP-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for the `GroundedProposer` optimizer. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for `GroundedProposer` from `TEST-PropGndP-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking proposed instructions, verifying interaction with prompt model).
- Identify how Python's features are used.
- Note dependencies on `Predict`, `Example`, `LM`.
- Identify complex setup for demo candidates or trial logs.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `GroundedProposer` test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PropGndP-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python `GroundedProposer` test:
    - [ ] Document core assertions.
    - [ ] Note how `GroundedProposer` instances, programs, prompt models, and trainsets are set up.
    - [ ] Identify Python-specific features used.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `GroundedProposer`.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TypeScript/Effect conversion.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python `GroundedProposer` test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding the internal signatures used by `GroundedProposer` (e.g., `DescribeProgram`).

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on core proposer logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis guides the TypeScript test implementation for `GroundedProposer`.
