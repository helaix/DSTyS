# Sequential Thinking Tool (`mcp_server-sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking`)

This tool aids in breaking down complex problems, planning multi-step tasks, and performing analysis that might require adjustments. It allows for a flexible thinking process where steps can be refined or revised.

## How it Works

You use this tool iteratively:
1.  Start with an initial problem statement or goal (`thoughtNumber: 1`). Estimate the `totalThoughts` needed, but know this can be adjusted.
2.  Provide subsequent `thought` messages to break down the problem, plan steps, or analyze aspects. Increment the `thoughtNumber` for each step.
3.  If you realize a previous thought needs correction or refinement, you can indicate this using `isRevision: true` and `revisesThought: <number>`.
4.  Continue adding thoughts until the plan or analysis is complete.
5.  Set `nextThoughtNeeded: false` on the final thought.

## Key Parameters

-   `thought`: The content of the current thinking step.
-   `thoughtNumber`: The sequence number of the current thought.
-   `totalThoughts`: The estimated total number of thoughts (can be revised).
-   `nextThoughtNeeded`: Boolean indicating if more thoughts are required. `false` signals the end of the process.
-   `isRevision`: (Optional) Boolean, set to `true` if this thought revises a previous one.
-   `revisesThought`: (Optional) If `isRevision` is true, the number of the thought being revised.
