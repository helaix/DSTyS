## Notes on Using This Template

This Project Overview template follows the process outlined in the issue:
1. Review all previous documents (PRD, Architecture, UX/UI Plan)
2. Identify major components and dependencies
3. Break down components into implementation chunks
4. Organize chunks into logical phases
5. Assess risks and develop mitigation strategies
6. Review with technical and product stakeholders

When using this template:
1. **Start with existing documentation**: Review the PRD, Architecture Document, and UX/UI Plan to understand the project requirements and technical approach.
2. **Identify components**: Break down the system into major functional components.
3. **Define phases**: Organize the implementation into logical phases based on dependencies and priorities.
4. **Create implementation chunks**: Break down components into manageable units of work.
5. **Assess risks**: Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
6. **Create a roadmap**: Develop a timeline with key milestones and resource allocations.
7. **Review with stakeholders**: Share the document with technical and product stakeholders for feedback.

Remember that a good Project Overview should:
- Provide a clear roadmap for implementation
- Break down complex systems into manageable chunks
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Assess and mitigate risks
- Establish a realistic timeline and resource allocation
