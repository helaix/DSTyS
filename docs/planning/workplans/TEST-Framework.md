# TEST-Framework

## Task ID
TEST-Framework

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS project requires a robust testing framework that supports test-driven development with Effect TS integration. We need to set up a testing infrastructure that allows for converting Python tests to TypeScript, provides good developer experience, and ensures high code quality through comprehensive test coverage.

## Proposed Implementation
We will set up a comprehensive testing framework for the DSTyS project, including:

1. Vitest as the primary testing framework
2. Integration with Effect TS for testing effectful code
3. Test utilities for common testing patterns
4. Mocking utilities for external dependencies
5. Code coverage reporting
6. Integration with the CI/CD pipeline

The implementation will focus on:
- Creating a testing environment that supports TypeScript and Effect TS
- Providing utilities for testing effectful code
- Setting up mocking capabilities for external dependencies
- Configuring code coverage reporting
- Creating a developer-friendly testing experience

We will ensure that the testing framework supports the test-driven development approach by making it easy to write and run tests, and by providing clear feedback on test results.

## Components Involved
- Testing framework (Vitest)
- Effect TS integration
- Mocking utilities
- Code coverage reporting
- CI/CD integration

## Dependencies
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Effect library
- Vitest
- c8 or istanbul for code coverage

  - [ ] Create mock implementations for common dependencies
  - [ ] Set up utilities for creating test doubles
- [ ] Configure code coverage
  - [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
  - [ ] Configure coverage thresholds
  - [ ] Set up coverage reporting in CI
- [ ] Create test utilities
  - [ ] Create utilities for common testing patterns
  - [ ] Set up fixtures and test data
  - [ ] Create assertion helpers

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm run test` to verify the testing setup works
2. Write a simple test with Effect TS integration and verify it runs correctly
3. Verify that code coverage reporting works
4. Check that mocking utilities work as expected
5. Verify that tests run correctly in CI
6. Check that test results are reported correctly
7. Verify that the testing framework supports the test-driven development approach

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Specific test utility implementations
  - Test file organization
  - Mocking approach
  - Code coverage configuration

- Requires user input:
  - Major testing framework changes
  - Code coverage thresholds
  - CI/CD integration strategy

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- What code coverage thresholds should we set?
- How should we handle testing of effectful code with Effect TS?
- What mocking strategy should we use for external dependencies?

### Non-blocking
- Specific test utility implementations can be refined over time
- Test file organization can be adjusted based on project needs
- Code coverage configuration can be refined as the project evolves

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may start with a simpler mocking approach and enhance it over time
- Initial code coverage thresholds may be lower and increased as the project matures
- We may defer setting up complex test fixtures until needed
- Performance optimizations for test runs can be implemented later

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The testing framework should be designed to accommodate future growth
- We should prioritize developer experience and ease of writing tests
- The testing approach should align with Effect TS's functional programming paradigm
- We should consider using property-based testing for complex components
