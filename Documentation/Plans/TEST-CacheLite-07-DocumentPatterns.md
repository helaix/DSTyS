# Workplan: Document LiteLLM Cache Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CacheLite-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the LiteLLM Caching component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar caching mechanisms.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `LiteLLMCache.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for setting up mock LMs, managing temporary cache directories), common assertion patterns for cache hits/misses, or specific ways Effect TS was used if caching is effectful.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different caching scenarios (in-memory, disk, cache key generation) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/caching/LiteLLMCache.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CacheLite-06-VerifyCoverage` (All LiteLLM Caching tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `LiteLLMCache.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to test cache hits vs. misses (e.g., by checking LM call counts).
    - How to set up and test in-memory caching.
    - How to set up and test disk caching (including temporary directory management).
    - Testing of cache key generation logic (if applicable).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for LiteLLM Caching tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to LiteLLM Caching testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers to testing practices for caching.
