# Workplan: Adapt Ensemble Optimizer Tests for TypeScript & Effect

## Task ID
TEST-TpEns-04-AdaptTests

## Problem Statement
Convert the logic and assertions from the Python `Ensemble` utility tests into the placeholder TypeScript/Vitest test cases. This involves translating Python code to TypeScript and adapting for static typing.

## Proposed Implementation
- For each placeholder test in `tests/teleprompt/Ensemble.test.ts`:
    - Translate the corresponding Python test logic into TypeScript.
    - Define necessary input data (mock programs, reduction functions) and expected outcomes.
    - Use `expect` assertions from Vitest.
    - If underlying program calls are Effectful, ensure tests handle this.
    - Ensure type safety in test code.

## Components Involved
- `tests/teleprompt/Ensemble.test.ts`.
- TypeScript, Vitest, Effect (if programs are Effectful).
- Mock `Module` and reduction functions.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpEns-03-CreateTSFiles` (Placeholder test files).
- `TEST-TpEns-05-CreateMocks` (Mocks for dependencies).
- Core DSTyS `Ensemble` utility and `Module` class structure.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Iterate through each placeholder test in `Ensemble.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement the test logic based on the original Python test.
    - Set up `Ensemble` instances with mock programs and reduction functions.
    - Call `ensembledProgram.forward(...)` or `ensembledProgram()`.
    - Assert the combined output (list or reduced value).
- [ ] Test scenarios:
    - Ensembling without reduction.
    - Ensembling with a reduction function.
    - Size limitation.
    - Deterministic behavior (if applicable and testable).
- [ ] For effectful program calls, test success and failure paths using Effect patterns if relevant.

## Verification Steps
- All converted `Ensemble` tests should initially fail.
- Test logic should be clear and target intended utility behavior.
- Type errors in test code should be resolved.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific assertion styles, mock data generation.
- User Input: Clarification on Python test behavior if ambiguous.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- The exact API of `Ensemble.compile` and the `EnsembledProgram` it returns.

### Non-blocking
- How deterministic ensembling is implemented and tested.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial tests might use very simple mock programs and reduction functions.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This is the core test conversion for the `Ensemble` utility.
