# Epic Overview: Signature Implementation (CORE-SignatureImplementation)

## Task ID
CORE-SignatureImplementation (Epic)

## Problem Statement
The Signature class is a core component of the DSTyS library, used to define the structure of inputs and outputs for modules. We need to implement the Signature class with TypeScript's type system, integrate it with Field types for defining individual fields, use Zod for runtime validation of data against the signature, and Effect for error handling during validation. The implementation must pass all the tests created in the TEST-SignatureTests task.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will implement the `Signature` class in TypeScript. Key aspects include:
- Defining the `Signature` class structure, possibly using a builder pattern or a class-based definition similar to Pydantic models for defining fields.
- Managing collections of input and output `Field` objects.
- Providing utilities for creating and manipulating signatures (e.g., adding/removing fields, extending signatures).
- Integrating with Zod: A `Signature` instance should be able to generate a composite Zod schema representing its overall structure, or validate an object against its fields' Zod schemas.
- Using Effect TS for error handling, especially during validation processes.
- Supporting signature metadata (like overall instructions/docstrings) and potentially documentation generation features.

The implementation will follow these principles:
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for defining signatures in a type-safe way.
- Use `Field` objects (with their own Zod schemas) as the building blocks for signatures.
- Integrate Zod for runtime validation of data objects against the entire signature.
- Use Effect for robust error handling during signature validation.
- Maintain conceptual compatibility with the Python DSPy `Signature` API, including string-based definitions (e.g., "question -> answer") and class-based definitions.

The `Signature` implementation is crucial for defining the contracts for `Module` interactions.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- `Signature` class
- `Field` type integration (managing collections of InputFields and OutputFields)
- Zod schema generation/integration for whole-signature validation
- Effect integration for validation error handling
- Utilities for signature definition (string-based, class-based) and manipulation

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-SignatureTests (must be completed first)
- CORE-FieldImplementation (must be completed first, as Signatures are composed of Fields)
- Zod library
- Effect library

## Granular Workplans
- [CORE-SigImpl-01-ClassDef](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-01-ClassDef.md) - Create Signature class definition
- [CORE-SigImpl-02-FieldMgmt](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-02-FieldMgmt.md) - Implement input and output field management
- [CORE-SigImpl-03-CreationUtils](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-03-CreationUtils.md) - Create signature creation utilities (string & class-based)
- [CORE-SigImpl-04-ZodIntegration](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-04-ZodIntegration.md) - Integrate with Zod for whole-signature validation
- [CORE-SigImpl-05-EffectIntegration](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-05-EffectIntegration.md) - Implement Effect integration for validation
- [CORE-SigImpl-06-Metadata](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-06-Metadata.md) - Implement signature metadata (instructions) & docs
- [CORE-SigImpl-07-TestCompatibility](../../Documentation/Plans/CORE-SigImpl-07-TestCompatibility.md) - Ensure test compatibility

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Internal representation of fields within a Signature.
  - TypeScript-specific adaptations for class-based signature definitions.
  - Utility function implementation details.
  - Error handling specifics for signature parsing/validation.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python DSPy's Signature API (string-based or class-based).
  - Handling of advanced features like signature inheritance if they differ from Python.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How to best handle Python's metaclass functionality (used for class-based Signatures in DSPy) in TypeScript. This might involve decorators, a builder pattern, or a different approach to class-based definition.
- Ensuring type safety for dynamically defined fields in string-based signatures (e.g., "question:string -> answer:int").

### Non-blocking
- Exact implementation details for utility functions like `Signature.equals()` or `Signature.with_instructions()`.
- Advanced features like automatic Pydantic model generation from Signatures.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- May need to adapt Python's very dynamic signature definition patterns to more explicit TypeScript mechanisms to ensure type safety.
- Initial support for string-based signatures might be simpler, with more complex type parsing (e.g., generics in strings) added iteratively.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The `Signature` class is fundamental for defining module contracts and enabling DSPy's compilation/optimization processes.
- The implementation should prioritize type safety and developer experience in TypeScript.
- Effect TS integration for validation will enhance robustness.
- This implementation builds upon the `Field` implementation.
