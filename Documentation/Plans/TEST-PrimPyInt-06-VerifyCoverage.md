# Workplan: Verify JS Interpreter Test Coverage (If Applicable)

## Task ID
TEST-PrimPyInt-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
If a `JavaScriptInterpreter.ts` tool is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves the target code coverage for this tool.

## Proposed Implementation
- **Conditional on implementing a JS Interpreter tool.**
- After the JS Interpreter implementation is complete and all tests in `TEST-PrimPyInt-04-AdaptTests` are passing:
    - Run the test suite with coverage reporting enabled (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Analyze the coverage report specifically for `source/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.ts`.
    - Identify any untested lines, branches, or functions.
    - Write additional tests to cover these gaps, if critical, aiming for >85-90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.ts` (the implementation, conditional).
- `tests/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` (the tests, conditional).
- Vitest coverage reporting tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-JavaScriptInterpreterImplementation` (Full implementation of the JS Interpreter - conceptual name, conditional).
- All JS Interpreter tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is in scope:
    - [ ] Ensure JS Interpreter implementation is complete and all existing tests pass.
    - [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
    - [ ] Examine the coverage report for `source/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.ts`.
    - [ ] If coverage is below target (e.g., 85%):
        - [ ] Identify specific lines/branches not covered.
        - [ ] Write new test cases in `JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` to cover these gaps.
        - [ ] Re-run coverage until target is met or remaining gaps are justified as non-critical.
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is out of scope, mark this task as N/A.

## Verification Steps
- If applicable, coverage report shows target coverage (e.g., >85%) for the JS Interpreter tool.
- All critical paths and functionalities of the JS Interpreter are covered by tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Writing additional tests.
- User Input: Acceptance of any coverage gaps if 100% is not feasible/practical.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Decision on implementing a JS interpreter.

### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex error handling or sandboxing logic.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May accept slightly below 100% coverage if the remaining uncovered code is trivial or extremely defensive.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good test coverage ensures the JS interpreter tool is reliable and secure if implemented.
