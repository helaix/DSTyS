# Workplan: Verify Adapter Image Handling Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-SigAdImg-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once image handling in `Image.ts`, `Field.ts`, and Adapters is implemented and tests pass, verify test suite coverage for these components.

## Proposed Implementation
- After image handling implementation and tests pass:
    - Run `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for `Image.ts`, and relevant parts of `Field.ts` and Adapter source files.
    - Add tests for uncovered parts, aiming for high coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/types/Image.ts` (or similar).
- Relevant adapter source files.
- `tests/signatures/AdapterImage.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ImageHandlingImplementation` (Conceptual).
- All image handling tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure image handling implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for relevant source files.
- [ ] If below target, add tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows high coverage for image handling logic.
- Critical paths (different image sources, adapter formatting) are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of error handling for invalid image data or URLs.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on core image processing and formatting logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures robust multimodal capabilities.
