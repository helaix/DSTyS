# Product Requirements Document (PRD): DSTyS - DSPy in TypeScript with Effect

## Document Information
- **Project Name**: DSTyS (DSPy in TypeScript with Effect)
- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-20
- **Author(s)**: Codegen
- **Status**: Draft
- **Approvers**: [Project Stakeholders]

## 1. Project Vision Statement

### 1.1 Overview
DSTyS is a TypeScript implementation of Stanford NLP's DSPy framework, leveraging the Effect library for functional programming paradigms. It aims to bring the powerful programming model for foundation models (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.) to the TypeScript ecosystem, enabling developers to build robust, composable, and optimizable AI systems using idiomatic TypeScript. **The implementation must achieve 100% feature parity with the Python version**, ensuring that all capabilities of DSPy are available to TypeScript developers.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current approaches to working with foundation models in the TypeScript ecosystem rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is brittle, hard to maintain, and difficult to optimize systematically. Developers need a more structured, programmatic approach to building AI systems that can:
- Be composed from reusable components
- Be automatically optimized
- Handle errors gracefully
- Be tested systematically
- Scale with increasing complexity

The Python ecosystem has DSPy, but TypeScript developers lack an equivalent framework that leverages TypeScript's strong typing and the functional programming capabilities of libraries like Effect.

### 1.3 Vision
DSTyS will become the standard framework for programming (not prompting) foundation models in the TypeScript ecosystem. It will enable developers to build complex AI systems using declarative, composable modules that can be automatically optimized, tested, and evaluated. By leveraging Effect's functional programming paradigms, DSTyS will provide robust error handling, testability, and maintainability that surpasses what's possible with traditional prompt engineering approaches. The implementation will maintain complete feature parity with the Python DSPy framework, ensuring that all techniques and patterns available in DSPy are accessible to TypeScript developers.

### 1.4 Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with the broader trend of moving from prompt engineering to programmatic approaches for working with foundation models. It brings the benefits of DSPy to the TypeScript ecosystem, leveraging TypeScript's strong typing and the functional programming capabilities of Effect to create a framework that is both powerful and developer-friendly.
