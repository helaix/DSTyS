# Workplan: Document BootstrapFewShot Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-TpBoot-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar teleprompters.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `BootstrapFewShot.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock student/teacher modules, mock trainsets, mock metrics), common assertion patterns for compiled programs or generated demos, or specific ways Effect TS was used if applicable.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `BootstrapFewShot` scenarios (e.g., successful compilation, error handling, metric evaluation) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/teleprompt/BootstrapFewShot.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpBoot-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `BootstrapFewShot` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `BootstrapFewShot.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock student and teacher modules.
    - How to create mock trainsets and metric functions.
    - Patterns for asserting the demos in the compiled student module.
    - Testing different configurations of the optimizer (e.g., `max_bootstrapped_demos`).
    - How to test error handling during the compilation process.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `BootstrapFewShot` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test complex optimizers.
