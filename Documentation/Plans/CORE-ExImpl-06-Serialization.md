# Workplan: Example Serialization and Deserialization

## Task ID
CORE-ExImpl-06-Serialization

## Problem Statement
Implement serialization and deserialization functionality for `Example` objects, allowing them to be easily converted to and from JSON format. This is essential for saving/loading datasets, transferring examples, and potentially for logging.

## Proposed Implementation
- Add a `toJSON()` method (or a more specific `serialize()` method) to the `Example` class that converts the internal store and any relevant metadata (like `_input_keys`) into a plain JSON object.
- Add a static factory method like `Example.fromJSON(jsonValue)` (or `deserialize(jsonValue)`) that reconstructs an `Example` instance from a JSON object.
- Ensure that common data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, nested objects) are handled correctly during serialization and deserialization.
- Consider how custom or complex types stored within an `Example` field (e.g., `Date` objects, custom classes) would be handled. This might require users to register custom serializers/deserializers or rely on a convention (e.g., ISO strings for dates).
- Testing: Test serialization to JSON and deserialization back to an `Example` object. Verify that the deserialized object is equivalent to the original. Test with examples containing various data types.

## Components Involved
- `source/primitives/Example.ts`

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ExImpl-01-ClassDef` (Example class definition)
- `CORE-ExImpl-02-DataStorage` (Example data storage)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Implement a `toJSON()` or `serialize()` method on the `Example` class.
    - This method should handle the `_store` and `_input_keys`.
- [ ] Implement a static `fromJSON()` or `deserialize()` method on the `Example` class.
    - This method should correctly reconstruct the `_store` and `_input_keys`.
- [ ] Write unit tests for serialization:
    - Serialize an `Example` and verify the JSON output.
    - Cover examples with different data types.
    - Cover examples with and without input keys defined.
- [ ] Write unit tests for deserialization:
    - Deserialize JSON and verify the reconstructed `Example` object.
    - Ensure `_input_keys` are correctly restored.
- [ ] Test round-trip serialization/deserialization (serialize then deserialize, check for equality).
- [ ] Document the serialization format and any conventions for complex types.

## Verification Steps
- Run unit tests for `Example.ts` focusing on serialization/deserialization.
- Ensure that `Example` objects can be reliably converted to JSON and back.
- Verify that all relevant data (fields, input keys) is preserved during the round trip.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Exact JSON structure for representing `_input_keys`.
- User Input: Strategy for handling non-standard JSON types within example fields (e.g., Dates, custom objects).

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- How to handle serialization of complex/custom objects stored as field values if they are not inherently JSON serializable. Python DSPy's `Example.toDict()` is simple, but TypeScript might require more explicit handling for type safety upon deserialization.

### Non-blocking
- Support for more advanced serialization formats (e.g., BSON) can be deferred.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial implementation might only support standard JSON-serializable types for field values, with a clear error or convention for unsupported types.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Robust serialization is important for interoperability, persistence, and debugging.
