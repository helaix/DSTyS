# Epic Overview: Testing Framework Setup (TEST-Framework)

## Task ID
TEST-Framework (Epic)

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS project requires a robust testing framework that supports test-driven development with Effect TS integration. We need to set up a testing infrastructure that allows for converting Python tests to TypeScript, provides good developer experience, and ensures high code quality through comprehensive test coverage.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will set up a comprehensive testing framework for the DSTyS project, including:
1. Vitest as the primary testing framework.
2. Integration with Effect TS for testing effectful code.
3. Test utilities for common testing patterns.
4. Mocking utilities for external dependencies.
5. Code coverage reporting.
6. Integration with the CI/CD pipeline.

The setup will focus on creating a testing environment that supports TypeScript and Effect TS, providing utilities for testing effectful code, and ensuring a developer-friendly testing experience.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Testing framework (Vitest)
- Effect TS integration
- Mocking utilities
- Code coverage reporting
- CI/CD integration

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Effect library
- Vitest
- c8 or istanbul for code coverage

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-Frmwk-01-SetupVitest](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-01-SetupVitest.md) - Set up Vitest
- [TEST-Frmwk-02-EffectIntegration](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-02-EffectIntegration.md) - Configure Effect TS integration
- [TEST-Frmwk-03-MockingUtils](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-03-MockingUtils.md) - Set up mocking utilities
- [TEST-Frmwk-04-CoverageConfig](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-04-CoverageConfig.md) - Configure code coverage
- [TEST-Frmwk-05-CreateTestUtils](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-05-CreateTestUtils.md) - Create test utilities
- [TEST-Frmwk-06-CICDIntegration](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-06-CICDIntegration.md) - Set up CI/CD integration
- [TEST-Frmwk-07-Documentation](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-Frmwk-07-Documentation.md) - Create documentation for testing framework

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Specific test utility implementations
  - Test file organization
  - Mocking approach
  - Code coverage configuration

- Requires user input:
  - Major testing framework changes
  - Code coverage thresholds
  - CI/CD integration strategy

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- What code coverage thresholds should we set?
- How should we handle testing of effectful code with Effect TS?
- What mocking strategy should we use for external dependencies?

### Non-blocking
- Specific test utility implementations can be refined over time
- Test file organization can be adjusted based on project needs
- Code coverage configuration can be refined as the project evolves

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- We may start with a simpler mocking approach and enhance it over time
- Initial code coverage thresholds may be lower and increased as the project matures
- We may defer setting up complex test fixtures until needed
- Performance optimizations for test runs can be implemented later

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The testing framework should be designed to accommodate future growth.
- We should prioritize developer experience and ease of writing tests.
- The testing approach should align with Effect TS's functional programming paradigm.
- We should consider using property-based testing for complex components.
