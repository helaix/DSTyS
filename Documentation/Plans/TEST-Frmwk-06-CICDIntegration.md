# Workplan: Integrate Tests into CI/CD Pipeline

## Task ID
TEST-Frmwk-06-CICDIntegration

## Problem Statement
Ensure that all automated tests are executed as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to maintain code quality and prevent regressions. This includes running tests, reporting results, and potentially uploading coverage reports.

## Proposed Implementation
- Modify the GitHub Actions CI workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created in `SETUP-ProjStruct-05-CICD`).
- Add a job or steps within an existing job to:
    - Install dependencies (`npm install` or equivalent).
    - Run all tests (e.g., `npm run test`).
    - Optionally, run tests with coverage (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Upload coverage reports as a build artifact (e.g., using `actions/upload-artifact`).
- Ensure the CI workflow fails if any tests fail.
- Optionally, configure the CI workflow to fail if coverage drops below a certain threshold (requires coverage data to be processed, e.g., by Codecov or Coveralls, or a custom script).

## Components Involved
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or similar CI configuration file).
- `package.json` (for test scripts).

## Dependencies
- `SETUP-ProjStruct-05-CICD` (Basic CI workflow exists).
- `TEST-Frmwk-01-SetupVitest` (Test scripts are defined).
- `TEST-Frmwk-04-CoverageConfig` (Coverage reporting is configured).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Edit the main CI workflow file (e.g., `ci.yml`).
- [ ] Add a step to run tests: `run: npm run test` (or chosen package manager equivalent).
- [ ] Add a step to run tests with coverage: `run: npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Add a step to upload the coverage report (e.g., `lcov.info` from `coverage/lcov.info`) using `actions/upload-artifact`.
    ```yaml
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 # or v4
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: coverage/lcov.info # or the entire coverage/html directory
    ```
- [ ] Ensure the CI job fails if the test script exits with a non-zero code.
- [ ] (Optional) Integrate with a service like Codecov or Coveralls for better coverage tracking and PR comments.

## Verification Steps
- Push a commit or create a PR to trigger the CI workflow.
- Verify that the test execution step runs.
- If tests pass, the workflow should pass.
- If tests fail (introduce a temporary failing test), the workflow should fail.
- Coverage artifacts are successfully uploaded and downloadable from the workflow run.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific GitHub Actions syntax, choice of artifact upload action.
- User Input: Decision to integrate with third-party coverage services like Codecov.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- Setting up PR comments for coverage changes.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Start with basic test execution and artifact upload. Integration with Codecov/Coveralls can be an enhancement.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
CI integration of tests is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase.
