## 4. API Design

### 4.1 API Overview
The DSTyS API is designed to be intuitive for TypeScript developers while maintaining feature parity with Python DSPy. It leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time safety and Effect for functional programming patterns and error handling.

### 4.2 Core API Components

#### 4.2.1 Signatures
Signatures define the input and output types for modules.

```typescript
// Example Signature Definition
const QuestionAnswerSignature = Signature({
  question: Field(String, "The question to answer"),
  answer: Field(String, "The answer to the question")
});
```

#### 4.2.2 Modules
Modules are the building blocks of DSTyS pipelines.

```typescript
// Example Module Definition
class QuestionAnswerer extends Module({
  input: QuestionSignature,
  output: AnswerSignature
}) {
  constructor(private lm: LanguageModel) {
    super();
  }

  forward = (input: Input<typeof QuestionSignature>) => {
    return this.lm.predict(
      QuestionAnswerSignature,
      { question: input.question }
    );
  };
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Predictors
Predictors are specialized modules that implement different prediction patterns.

```typescript
// Example Chain of Thought Predictor
const answerer = new ChainOfThought({
  signature: QuestionAnswerSignature,
  lm: new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-4" })
});
```

### 4.3 Leveraging Effect's Type System

DSTyS leverages Effect's powerful type system to provide compile-time safety for errors, dependencies, and success values. The Effect type has three type parameters:

```typescript
// General form of an Effect
//    ┌─── Represents the success type
//    │ ┌─── Represents the error type
//    │ │ ┌─── Represents required dependencies
//    ↓ ↓ ↓
Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>
```

#### 4.3.1 Type-Safe Error Handling

Unlike traditional TypeScript where errors are not tracked in the type system, Effect makes errors part of the type signature:

```typescript
// Traditional TypeScript - errors are not tracked in the type system
const divide = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
  }
  return a / b;
};

// Effect approach - errors are tracked in the type system
class DivisionError {
  readonly _tag = "DivisionError";
  constructor(readonly message: string) {}
}

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number, DivisionError, never> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new DivisionError("Cannot divide by zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(a / b);
```

This allows for compile-time checking of error handling:

```typescript
// The type signature tells us exactly what can go wrong
const calculateAverage = (values: number[]): Effect.Effect<number, DivisionError, never> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const sum = values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
    // TypeScript knows this might fail with DivisionError
    const average = yield* divide(sum, values.length);
    return average;
  });

// We must handle the error or propagate it
const safeCalculateAverage = (values: number[]): Effect.Effect<number, never, never> =>
  calculateAverage(values).pipe(
    Effect.catchTag("DivisionError", (error) =>
      Effect.succeed(0) // Provide a default value in case of error
    )
  );
```

#### 4.3.2 Tagged Errors for Pattern Matching

Effect uses tagged errors to enable precise error handling through pattern matching:

```typescript
// Define different error types with unique tags
class NetworkError {
  readonly _tag = "NetworkError";
  constructor(readonly message: string) {}
}

class ValidationError {
  readonly _tag = "ValidationError";
  constructor(readonly field: string, readonly message: string) {}
}

class AuthError {
  readonly _tag = "AuthError";
  constructor(readonly reason: string) {}
}

// Function that can fail with different error types
const fetchUserData = (userId: string): Effect.Effect<UserData, NetworkError | ValidationError | AuthError, never> => {
  // Implementation...
};

// Handle specific error types
const result = await fetchUserData("user123").pipe(
  Effect.catchTag("NetworkError", (error) =>
    Effect.retry(fetchUserData("user123"), {
      schedule: Schedule.exponential(100, 2),
      times: 3
    })
  ),
  Effect.catchTag("ValidationError", (error) =>
    Effect.succeed({ name: "Unknown", id: "user123" }) // Default data
  ),
  Effect.catchTag("AuthError", (error) =>
    Effect.fail(new Error(`Authentication failed: ${error.reason}`))
  ),
  Effect.runPromise
);
```

#### 4.3.3 Dependency Injection with Context.Tag

Effect provides a powerful dependency injection system using `Context.Tag`:

```typescript
import { Effect, Context } from "effect";

// Define a service interface
interface LoggerService {
  log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void, never, never>;
  error: (message: string, error?: unknown) => Effect.Effect<void, never, never>;
}

// Create a service tag
class Logger extends Context.Tag("LoggerService")<Logger, LoggerService>() {}

// Implement the service
const ConsoleLoggerLive: Effect.Layer<Logger, never, never> = Effect.layer({
  build: () => ({
    log: (message) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(message)),
    error: (message, error) => Effect.sync(() => console.error(message, error))
  })
});

// Use the service in your application code
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Access the logger service
  const logger = yield* Logger;
  
  yield* logger.log("Starting application...");
  
  try {
    // Application logic
    yield* logger.log("Application running");
  } catch (error) {
    yield* logger.error("Application error", error);
  }
});

// Provide the implementation at the edge of your application
const runnable = program.pipe(
  Effect.provide(ConsoleLoggerLive)
);

Effect.runPromise(runnable);
```

#### 4.3.4 Composing Services with Dependencies

Services can depend on other services, creating a dependency graph that Effect manages automatically:

```typescript
// Database service
interface DatabaseService {
  query: (sql: string) => Effect.Effect<QueryResult, DatabaseError, never>;
}

class Database extends Context.Tag("DatabaseService")<Database, DatabaseService>() {}

// User repository service that depends on Database
interface UserRepositoryService {
  findById: (id: string) => Effect.Effect<User, DatabaseError | NotFoundError, never>;
}

class UserRepository extends Context.Tag("UserRepositoryService")<UserRepository, UserRepositoryService>() {}

// Implementation of UserRepository that depends on Database
const UserRepositoryLive: Effect.Layer<UserRepository, never, Database> = Effect.layer({
  build: (context) => {
    // Get the database service from the context
    const db = context.get(Database);
    
    return {
      findById: (id) => Effect.gen(function* () {
        const result = yield* db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${id}'`);
        
        if (result.rows.length === 0) {
          return yield* Effect.fail(new NotFoundError(`User with id ${id} not found`));
        }
        
        return result.rows[0] as User;
      })
    };
  }
});

// Application code that uses UserRepository
const getUserDetails = (userId: string): Effect.Effect<UserDetails, DatabaseError | NotFoundError, UserRepository> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const userRepo = yield* UserRepository;
    const user = yield* userRepo.findById(userId);
    return {
      id: user.id,
      name: user.name,
      email: user.email
    };
  });

// Provide all dependencies at the edge of your application
const runnable = getUserDetails("user123").pipe(
  Effect.provide(UserRepositoryLive),
  Effect.provide(DatabaseLive)
);

Effect.runPromise(runnable);
```

#### 4.3.5 Specific Effect TS Patterns per Architectural Layer
While Effect TS provides a rich set of tools, their application will be tailored to the needs of different architectural layers within DSTyS:

-   **Core Primitives (Signatures, Modules, Predictors)**:
    -   `Effect.succeed` and `Effect.fail` for basic success/failure paths.
    -   `Effect.map`, `Effect.flatMap` (`Effect.gen`) for composing operations.
    -   Tagged unions for representing specific error states (e.g., `SignatureValidationError`, `ModuleExecutionError`).
    -   `Effect.Schema` for robust parsing and validation of inputs and outputs, especially when dealing with dynamic structures or external data.

-   **Language Model Clients (LM Clients)**:
    -   `Effect.tryPromise` for wrapping API calls to external LM services.
    -   `Effect.retry` with `Schedule` for implementing robust retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff for API rate limits).
    -   `Effect.Layer` for managing dependencies like HTTP clients or API key providers.
    -   `Effect.Scope` for managing resources like network connections.
    -   `Effect.Cache` for caching LM responses.
    -   `Effect.Stream` for handling streaming responses from LMs.

-   **Prediction Modules (ChainOfThought, ReAct, etc.)**:
    -   `Effect.gen` (generator-based do-notation) for sequencing complex reasoning steps.
    -   `Effect.all` (for parallelism) or `Effect.forEach(..., { concurrency: "inherit" | number })` for concurrent tool calls or parallel sub-module executions.
    -   Custom tagged error types to represent failures specific to a prediction strategy (e.g., `ToolExecutionError` in ReAct).
    -   State management using immutable updates passed through `Effect` computations, or via `Ref` for localized mutable state if absolutely necessary and carefully managed.

-   **Optimization (Teleprompt)**:
    -   `Effect.Layer` for injecting dependencies like metrics, datasets, or teacher models.
    -   `Effect.forEach(..., { concurrency: "inherit" | number })` for parallel evaluation of candidate programs.
    -   `Effect.Scope` for managing resources during long-running optimization processes.
    -   `Effect.tap` for logging and tracing intermediate states during optimization.
    -   Error handling to gracefully manage failures in individual optimization trials without halting the entire process.

-   **Retrieval**:
    -   `Effect.tryPromise` for interacting with vector databases or search APIs.
    -   `Effect.Layer` for managing database connections or search client instances.
    -   `Effect.Cache` for caching retrieval results.

This layer-specific application of Effect TS patterns aims to maximize the benefits of the library while keeping the complexity appropriate for each component's responsibilities. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) will further detail these patterns and their rationale.

### 4.4 API Documentation
The API will be documented using TypeDoc with the following components:
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Tutorials and guides

### 4.5 Architectural Strategy for Python's Dynamic Features
Python DSPy leverages dynamic features (e.g., metaclasses for `Signature`, dynamic attribute assignment for `Predictor.demos`, runtime modification of signatures by modules like `ChainOfThought`) that do not have direct equivalents in TypeScript or are not idiomatic with Effect TS. DSTyS will address these through the following strategies, to be detailed in an **Architectural Decision Record (ADR) on "Translating Pythonic Dynamism"**:

-   **Signatures**:
    -   Instead of metaclasses, DSTyS Signatures will likely use a combination of:
        -   **Builder Patterns**: Fluent APIs for constructing and modifying signatures in a type-safe manner.
        -   **Advanced Generics and Conditional Types**: To infer and enforce relationships between input/output fields at compile time.
        -   **Immutable Transformations**: Functions that take a signature and return a new, modified signature, preserving immutability.
    -   Runtime validation of signature structures will be handled by Zod, integrated via `Effect.Schema`.

-   **Predictor State (e.g., `demos`)**:
    -   Dynamic attribute assignment will be replaced with explicit state management mechanisms:
        -   **Immutable Updates**: Methods that return new `Predictor` instances with updated state (e.g., new demos).
        -   **Context Passing**: For state that varies per call, relevant context can be passed explicitly.
        -   **Effect `Ref` or `FiberRef`**: For localized, managed mutable state if strictly necessary, ensuring functional purity at the boundaries. `Effect.Layer` can provide stateful services.

-   **Module-driven Signature Modification (e.g., `ChainOfThought` adding `rationale`)**:
    -   Runtime modification of signatures will be handled through:
        -   **Explicit Composition**: Modules like `ChainOfThought` will clearly define their output signature, including added fields like `rationale`. The composition of such modules will result in a new, well-defined signature.
        -   **Type-level Transformations**: TypeScript's mapped types or conditional types might be explored to represent how a module transforms an input signature into an output signature at the type level, enhancing static guarantees.

The ADR will provide concrete code patterns and justifications for these approaches, prioritizing type safety, functional purity, and developer experience within the TypeScript/Effect TS paradigm.

### 4.6 API Versioning Strategy
DSTyS will follow semantic versioning:
- **Major versions**: Breaking changes
- **Minor versions**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **Patch versions**: Bug fixes, non-breaking changes

### 4.7 Serialization/Deserialization Strategy
The ability to save and load `Module` states (including `Predictor` configurations like demos, LM settings, and compiled optimizer states) is crucial for reproducibility and sharing trained programs. DSTyS will implement this with the following considerations:

-   **Data Format**: JSON will be the primary serialization format for its ubiquity and human-readability.
-   **Schema Definition and Validation**:
    -   Zod schemas will be defined for all serializable components (`Module`, `Predictor`, `Signature`, `Example`, `LM` configurations, etc.).
    -   These schemas will be used for validation during deserialization to ensure data integrity and catch versioning issues. `Effect.Schema` can be used to integrate Zod schemas into Effect-based workflows.
-   **Custom Serializers/Deserializers**:
    -   For complex objects or Effect-specific constructs (if any are directly serialized, though this should be minimized), custom serialization logic might be needed.
    -   Pydantic-like models in TypeScript (potentially using classes with Zod schemas or dedicated libraries) will define `toJSON()` and `fromJSON()` (or equivalent static factory) methods.
-   **Handling Effect-wrapped State**:
    -   Generally, Effect computations themselves are not serialized. Instead, the *configuration* or *data* that defines these computations will be serialized.
    -   For example, if an optimizer's state involves Effect `Ref`s or `Fiber`s, the underlying data in those `Ref`s would be extracted and serialized, not the Effect constructs themselves. Upon deserialization, new Effect constructs would be initialized with the loaded data.
-   **Versioning**: Serialized formats will include a version number to handle schema evolution and provide migration paths or clear error messages for incompatible versions.
-   **Extensibility**: The serialization mechanism should be extensible to allow users to define how custom `Module` subclasses are serialized and deserialized.

A dedicated `save(path: string)` and static `load(path: string): Effect<Module, Error>` method will be provided on the `Module` base class.

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 Data Model Overview

```typescript
interface SignatureDefinition {
  fields: Record<string, FieldDefinition>;
  description?: string;
}

interface FieldDefinition {
  type: Type<any>;
  description: string;
  required: boolean;
  default?: any;
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Module
Represents a composable unit of functionality.

```typescript
interface ModuleDefinition {
  input: SignatureDefinition;
  output: SignatureDefinition;
}

interface Module<I, O> {
  forward: (input: I) => Effect<O, Error, never>;
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Prediction

        string provider
        string model
    }
```

### 5.4 Data Storage
As a library, DSTyS itself doesn't store data persistently, but it provides interfaces for caching predictions:

```typescript
interface Cache {
  get: (key: string) => Effect<Prediction<any> | null, Error, never>;
  set: (key: string, value: Prediction<any>) => Effect<void, Error, never>;
}
```

Implementations will be provided for:
- In-memory cache
- File-based cache
- Redis cache
- Others as needed

## 7. Test-Driven Development Strategy

### 7.1 Testing Approach
DSTyS will follow a test-driven development approach, with tests written before implementation to ensure that the library meets its requirements and maintains feature parity with Python DSPy.

### 7.2 Test Levels

#### 7.2.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Use property-based testing for complex logic

```typescript
// Example Unit Test
test("Signature validates input correctly", () => {
  const signature = Signature({
    name: Field(String, "Person's name"),
    age: Field(Number, "Person's age")
  });
  
  // Valid input
  expect(signature.validate({ name: "John", age: 30 })).toEqual({ name: "John", age: 30 });
  
  // Invalid input
  expect(() => signature.validate({ name: "John", age: "30" })).toThrow();
});
```

#### 7.2.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Test integration with external services using mocks
- Focus on component interfaces

```typescript
// Example Integration Test
test("Module uses language model correctly", async () => {
  const mockLM = {
    predict: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ output: { answer: "Paris" } })
  };
  
  const module = new QuestionAnswerer(mockLM);
  const result = await module.forward({ question: "What is the capital of France?" });
  
  expect(result).toEqual({ answer: "Paris" });
  expect(mockLM.predict).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.anything(),
    { question: "What is the capital of France?" }
  );
});
```

#### 7.2.3 System Testing
- Test complete pipelines
- Test with real external services in controlled environments
- Focus on end-to-end behavior

```typescript
// Example System Test
test("Complete pipeline works end-to-end", async () => {
  // Set up a complete pipeline
  const lm = new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
  const retriever = new VectorRetriever(/* ... */);
  const answerer = new RAG({ lm, retriever });
  
  // Test with a real question
  const result = await answerer.forward({ question: "What is TypeScript?" });
  
  // Verify the result meets expectations
  expect(result.answer).toContain("programming language");
});
```

#### 7.2.4 Performance Testing
- Benchmark key operations
- Compare performance with direct API calls
- Identify and address bottlenecks

```typescript
// Example Performance Test
benchmark("Prediction performance", async () => {
  const lm = new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
  const module = new QuestionAnswerer(lm);
  
  // Warm-up
  await module.forward({ question: "Warm-up question?" });
  
  // Benchmark
  const start = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await module.forward({ question: `Question ${i}?` });
  }
  const end = performance.now();
  
  expect(end - start).toBeLessThan(10000); // Less than 1s per question on average
});
```

### 7.3 Test Environments
- **Local**: Developer machines for rapid iteration
- **CI**: Automated tests on pull requests
- **Staging**: Tests with real external services before release
- **Production**: Smoke tests after deployment

### 7.4 Test Data Management
- Use fixture data for repeatable tests
- Generate synthetic data for edge cases
- Use anonymized real data for realistic scenarios
- Version control test data alongside code

### 7.5 Continuous Integration and Delivery
- Run tests on every pull request
- Block merges if tests fail
- Run comprehensive test suite before releases
- Automate release process
