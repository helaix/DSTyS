# Workplan: Analyze Signature Custom Types Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-SigCustTy-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of Python tests for custom types in signatures, focusing on how Pydantic models are defined, used in `dspy.Signature`, and how their correct resolution and usage are asserted.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case using Pydantic models in signatures.
- Document:
    - How Pydantic models are defined (e.g., nested classes, global classes).
    - How `dspy.Signature` fields are typed using these Pydantic models (e.g., `input: CustomType` or `output: OuterContainer.InnerType`).
    - How tests assert that the `annotation` attribute of a `Field` correctly resolves to the Pydantic model.
    - Any tests involving actual data validation against these Pydantic models (though this might be more in adapter tests).
- Identify challenges for translating this to Zod schemas and TypeScript classes.

## Components Involved
- Python custom type test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-SigCustTy-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python test using Pydantic models in signatures:
    - [ ] Document the Pydantic model definitions.
    - [ ] Analyze how these models are referenced in signature strings or class-based signatures.
    - [ ] Note the assertions made (e.g., `sig.input_fields["input"].annotation == CustomType`).
- [ ] List key challenges for Zod/TypeScript (e.g., string-based resolution of Zod schemas, representing nested Zod types).

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately describes Pydantic model usage in Python signature tests.
- Conversion challenges for Zod/TypeScript are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How Python's dynamic type resolution (e.g., `eval` for type strings) works and how to achieve similar flexibility with Zod/TS if needed.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on the core patterns of defining and asserting custom types in signatures.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Understanding these patterns is crucial for testing Zod-based custom type handling in DSTyS signatures.
