# Workplan: Document COPRO Optimizer Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-TpCopro-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `COPRO` optimizer. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar teleprompters that involve instruction generation and iterative optimization.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `COPRO.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock student modules, prompt models, metrics), common assertion patterns for optimized instructions or prefixes, or specific ways Effect TS was used if applicable.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `COPRO` scenarios (e.g., successful optimization, statistics tracking) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/teleprompt/COPRO.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpCopro-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `COPRO` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `COPRO.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock student modules and prompt models.
    - How to create mock trainsets and metric functions.
    - Patterns for asserting the optimized instructions/prefixes in the student module.
    - Testing different configurations of the optimizer (e.g., `breadth`, `depth`).
    - How to test statistics tracking if enabled.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `COPRO` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `COPRO` optimizer testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test complex optimizers.
