# Workplan: Analyze Adapter Image Handling Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-SigAdImg-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of Python tests for image handling in signatures/adapters, focusing on how `dspy.Image` objects are created, passed to modules, and how adapters format them.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for image handling.
- Document:
    - How `dspy.Image` instances are created (from URL, file, PIL).
    - How signatures define image fields.
    - How adapters (e.g., `ChatAdapter`) format messages containing `dspy.Image` objects.
    - Assertions made on the formatted messages or adapter outputs.
- Identify challenges for replicating this in TypeScript (e.g., PIL alternative, binary data handling).

## Components Involved
- Python image handling test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-SigAdImg-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python image handling test:
    - [ ] Document `dspy.Image` instantiation methods used.
    - [ ] Analyze how signatures with image fields are defined.
    - [ ] Note how adapter `format` methods are tested with image inputs.
    - [ ] Detail assertions on the structure of messages (e.g., `image_url` parts).
- [ ] List key challenges for TypeScript (e.g., no direct PIL equivalent, handling image fetching and base64 encoding).

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately describes Python image handling test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How to handle image downloading and encoding in a test environment for TypeScript.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on the core patterns of image representation and adapter formatting.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Understanding these patterns is crucial for testing multimodal capabilities in DSTyS.
