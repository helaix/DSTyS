# Workplan: Document Ensemble Optimizer Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-TpEns-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `Ensemble` utility. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar utilities that combine outputs from multiple components.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Ensemble.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock programs, mock reduction functions), common assertion patterns for ensembled outputs, or specific ways Effect TS was used if applicable.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `Ensemble` scenarios (e.g., with/without reduction, size limits) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/teleprompt/Ensemble.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpEns-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `Ensemble` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Ensemble.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock programs for ensembling.
    - How to create and test with mock reduction functions.
    - Patterns for asserting the combined list of outputs or the reduced output.
    - Testing different configurations of the `Ensemble` utility (e.g., `size`).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `Ensemble` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `Ensemble` utility testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test utilities that aggregate results.
