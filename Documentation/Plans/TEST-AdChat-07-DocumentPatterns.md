# Workplan: Document Chat Adapter Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-AdChat-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `ChatAdapter` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar adapter components.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `ChatAdapter.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock Signatures, LMs, Examples), common assertion patterns for message structures, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing adapter logic.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how `ChatAdapter`'s formatting and parsing methods were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/adapters/ChatAdapter.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-AdChat-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `ChatAdapter` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `ChatAdapter.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How `ChatAdapter.format` is tested with different Signatures and inputs.
    - How `ChatAdapter.parse` is tested with various LM response strings.
    - How interactions with a mock `LM` are tested.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `ChatAdapter` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `ChatAdapter` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers to testing practices for adapters.
For broader context, see [Epic Overview: Chat Adapter Tests Conversion (TEST-AdaptersChatTests)](../../docs/planning/workplans/TEST-AdaptersChatTests.md).
