# Workplan: Identify Python Field Tests

## Task ID
TEST-FldTests-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
Locate and list all Python test files and specific test cases within the DSPy repository that are relevant to the functionality of the `dspy.Field` type. This forms the basis for the test conversion effort.

## Proposed Implementation
- Thoroughly examine the `tests/signatures/test_signature.py` file in the Python DSPy repository, as `Field` tests are often co-located with `Signature` tests.
- Identify any other test files that might implicitly test `dspy.Field` functionality.
- Create a checklist or list of all Python test functions/methods related to `Field` (e.g., tests for field instantiation, metadata, constraints).
- For each identified test, briefly note its purpose or the specific `Field` feature it targets.
- Testing: This task is investigative; verification involves confirming that the list of identified tests is comprehensive.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (specifically `tests/signatures/test_signature.py` and potentially `tests/primitives/`).
- Analysis and documentation tools.

## Dependencies
- Access to the Python DSPy repository.
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate` (for understanding how tests will be structured).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Navigate to `tests/signatures/test_signature.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions/methods that specifically test `dspy.Field` properties, instantiation, or behavior.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding `dspy.Field`.
- [ ] Briefly scan other relevant test files for significant, direct tests of `Field`.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases for `Field` to be ported.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against relevant DSPy test files to ensure completeness for `Field` testing.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test for `Field` is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: How to organize the list of identified tests.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- Some Python tests might test `Field` in conjunction with `Signature`; these need to be clearly delineated.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on tests directly exercising `Field` capabilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
A clear inventory of existing Python tests for `Field` is the first step to ensuring comprehensive test coverage in the TypeScript port.
