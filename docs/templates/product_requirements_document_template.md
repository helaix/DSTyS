## Notes on Using This Template

1. **Stream-of-Consciousness Process**:
   - Begin by recording your thoughts about the product vision
   - Don't worry about structure or completeness at this stage
   - Focus on capturing the essence of what you're trying to build and why

2. **Initial Draft Organization**:
   - Transcribe your recording
   - Organize thoughts into relevant sections of this template
   - Identify gaps that need further development

3. **Refinement Process**:
   - Fill in all sections of the template
   - Ensure all key components are addressed
   - Review for clarity, completeness, and consistency

4. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Share the draft with key stakeholders
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any conflicting requirements

5. **Finalization**:
   - Update the document based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

Remember that a good PRD should be:
- Clear and unambiguous
- Focused on WHAT, not HOW
- Measurable
- Testable
- Traceable (requirements can be tracked through implementation)
