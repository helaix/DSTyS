# Workplan: Verify Databricks Client Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-CliDBX-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the `DatabricksLM.ts` client is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves the target code coverage for the Databricks client components.

## Proposed Implementation
- After the `DatabricksLM` client implementation is complete and all tests in `TEST-CliDBX-04-AdaptTests` (and any subsequently added tests) are passing:
    - Run the test suite with coverage reporting enabled (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Analyze the coverage report specifically for `source/clients/DatabricksLM.ts` (or relevant files).
    - Identify any untested lines, branches, or functions, particularly around API interaction logic and error handling.
    - Write additional tests to cover these gaps, if critical, aiming for >80-85% coverage (as full coverage of all API error paths might be extensive).

## Components Involved
- `source/clients/DatabricksLM.ts` (the implementation).
- `tests/clients/DatabricksClient.test.ts` (the tests).
- Vitest coverage reporting tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ClientsDatabricksImplementation` (Full implementation of the Databricks Client).
- All Databricks Client tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure Databricks Client implementation is complete and all existing tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine the coverage report for relevant Databricks client source files.
- [ ] If coverage is below target (e.g., 80%):
    - [ ] Identify specific lines/branches not covered.
    - [ ] Write new test cases in `DatabricksClient.test.ts` to cover these gaps, focusing on logic within the client rather than exhaustive mocking of all Databricks API states.
    - [ ] Re-run coverage until target is met or remaining gaps are justified.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows target coverage (e.g., >80%) for Databricks Client components.
- All critical paths and functionalities of the Databricks Client are covered by tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Writing additional tests.
- User Input: Acceptance of any coverage gaps if 100% is not feasible/practical due to complex API mocking.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None, assuming implementation and basic tests are done.

### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex error handling paths for various Databricks API responses.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May accept slightly lower coverage than core primitives if extensive API mocking for edge cases proves too costly for the benefit.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good test coverage for LM provider clients ensures reliability when interacting with external services.
