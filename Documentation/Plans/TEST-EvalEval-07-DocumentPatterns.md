# Workplan: Document Evaluate Utility Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-EvalEval-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `Evaluate` utility. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing components that use or interact with the evaluation framework.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Evaluate.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock programs, devsets, metrics), common assertion patterns for evaluation results, or specific ways multi-threading/parallelism was tested.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `Evaluate` configurations and scenarios were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/evaluate/Evaluate.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-EvalEval-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `Evaluate` utility tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Evaluate.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock programs, devsets, and metrics for `Evaluate` tests.
    - Patterns for asserting evaluation scores and detailed results.
    - Testing different `Evaluate` configurations (e.g., `num_threads`, display options).
    - How to test error handling during evaluation.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `Evaluate` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `Evaluate` utility testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test evaluation processes.
