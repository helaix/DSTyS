# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for Ensemble Optimizer Tests

## Task ID
TEST-TpEns-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Identify and create necessary mock implementations or test utilities for `Ensemble` utility tests. This includes mock programs and mock reduction functions.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the converted `Ensemble` tests from `TEST-TpEns-04-AdaptTests`.
- Create helper functions or mock classes for:
    - **Mock Program**: Simple `dspy.Module` subclasses that return predefined outputs.
    - **Mock Reduction Function**: A function that takes a list of outputs and returns a combined value (e.g., sum, average, majority vote).
- Place mocks in `tests/utils/mocks/` or alongside `Ensemble.test.ts`.

## Components Involved
- `tests/teleprompt/Ensemble.test.ts`.
- `tests/utils/mocks/` (for shared mocks).
- Mock implementations for `Module` and reduction functions.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpEns-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests will drive the need for specific mock behaviors).
- Core DSTyS `Module` class structure.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `MockProgramForEnsemble` class (extends `dspy.Module`):
    - Constructor takes a predefined output value.
    - `forward` method returns this predefined output.
- [ ] Create `mockSumReduceFn(outputs: number[]): number`.
- [ ] Create `mockAverageReduceFn(outputs: number[]): number`.
- [ ] Create `mockMajorityVoteReduceFn(outputs: string[]): string`.
- [ ] Integrate these mocks into `Ensemble.test.ts`.

## Verification Steps
- Mocks and test utilities simplify `Ensemble` test code.
- Tests using mocks correctly isolate the `Ensemble` utility's logic.
- Mocks accurately simulate the behavior of programs and reduction functions.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details of mocks.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- The exact interface of `Module.forward` that `Ensemble` will call.

### Non-blocking
- Mocks can be refined as the actual `Ensemble` utility is implemented.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial mock programs can return very simple, fixed values.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Well-designed mocks are essential for testing the logic of combining multiple program outputs.
