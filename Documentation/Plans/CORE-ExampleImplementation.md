# CORE-ExampleImplementation

## Task ID
CORE-ExampleImplementation

## Problem Statement
The Example class is a core component of the DSTyS library, used to represent examples for few-shot learning. We need to implement the Example class with TypeScript's type system and integrate it with Signature, Zod for runtime validation, and Effect for error handling. The implementation must pass all the tests created in the TEST-ExampleTests task.

## Proposed Implementation
We will implement the Example class in TypeScript, integrating it with Signature, Zod for runtime validation, and Effect for error handling. The implementation will include:

1. Creating the Example class definition with TypeScript generics
2. Implementing example data storage and access
3. Creating example creation and manipulation utilities
4. Integrating with Signature for type validation
5. Using Effect for error handling
6. Implementing serialization and deserialization

The implementation will follow these principles:
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Integrate Effect for error handling and functional patterns
- Maintain compatibility with the Python DSPy API
- Provide a type-safe and developer-friendly API

The Example implementation will serve as a foundation for the Prediction class and few-shot learning capabilities.

2. Verify that all tests pass
3. Check that the implementation follows TypeScript and Effect TS best practices
4. Verify that the Example class works correctly with Signature
5. Ensure that the Example class can be used in other components
6. Check that the implementation is compatible with the Python DSPy API
7. Verify that the implementation handles edge cases correctly

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Implementation details
  - TypeScript-specific adaptations
  - Utility function implementation
  - Error handling details

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python API
  - Additional features not present in Python version
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Example

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's dynamic object creation in TypeScript?
- What is the best way to implement serialization and deserialization in TypeScript?
- How should we handle complex data types in examples?

### Non-blocking
- Exact implementation details can be refined over time
- Utility function implementation can be adjusted based on experience
- Additional features can be added as needed

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may need to adapt some Python patterns to work better with TypeScript
- Initial implementation may not include all Python features
- Some Python-specific features may need different approaches in TypeScript
- We may need to create additional utilities not present in the Python version

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The Example class is a fundamental building block for few-shot learning, so its implementation is critical
- The implementation should focus on maintaining functional equivalence while leveraging TypeScript features
- Effect TS integration is a key aspect of the TypeScript implementation
- This implementation will build on the patterns established in the Field and Signature implementations
