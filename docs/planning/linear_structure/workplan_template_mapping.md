# Workplan Template to Linear Issue Field Mapping

This document provides a detailed mapping between the workplan template sections and Linear issue fields, ensuring consistency between documentation and issue tracking.

## Overview

The workplan template contains several sections that need to be represented in Linear issues. This mapping ensures that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced.

```
Title: [Task Title]

## Task Description
[Detailed description of the task]

## Implementation Details
[Specific implementation instructions]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]

## Automation Recommendations

To facilitate the mapping between workplan documents and Linear issues, the following automation is recommended:

1. **Document to Issue Conversion**: A script that converts a workplan document to a Linear issue using the Linear API
2. **Issue to Document Conversion**: A script that generates a workplan document from a Linear issue
3. **Synchronization Tool**: A tool that keeps workplan documents and Linear issues in sync
4. **Status Update Automation**: Automation that updates the status of a workplan document when the Linear issue status changes
5. **Sub-Issue Creation**: Automation that creates sub-issues for each task in a workplan

These automations can be implemented using the Linear API and GitHub Actions to ensure consistency between documentation and issue tracking.
