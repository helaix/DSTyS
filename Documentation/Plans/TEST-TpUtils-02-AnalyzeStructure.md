# Workplan: Analyze Teleprompt Utils Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-TpUtils-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of Python tests for teleprompt utilities, focusing on how functions like `eval_candidate_program` are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test for teleprompt utils.
- Document:
    - Setup of mock programs, trainsets, evaluation functions.
    - Assertions made on the utility function outputs.
- Identify challenges for TypeScript conversion.

## Components Involved
- Python teleprompt utils test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpUtils-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python teleprompt utils test:
    - [ ] Document core assertions.
    - [ ] Note setup of mock components.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TS/Effect conversion.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python teleprompt utils test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on core utility logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Understanding this is key for testing teleprompt utilities in DSTyS.
