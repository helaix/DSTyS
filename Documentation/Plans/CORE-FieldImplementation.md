# CORE-FieldImplementation

## Task ID
CORE-FieldImplementation

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS library requires a Field type that defines and validates individual fields within Signatures. This is a core primitive that enables type-safe interaction with foundation models. We need to implement the Field type with proper TypeScript typing and integration with Effect for error handling and Zod for runtime type validation.

## Proposed Implementation
We will implement a Field type that represents a typed field with validation capabilities. The implementation will include:

1. A Field interface that defines the structure of a field, including its type, description, and validation function
2. A Field factory function that creates Field instances with the specified type, description, and options
3. Integration with Zod for runtime type validation
4. Integration with Effect for functional error handling
5. Support for optional fields and default values
6. Comprehensive error messages for validation failures

The Field implementation will be type-safe, leveraging TypeScript's generics to ensure that the field's type is properly propagated throughout the system. It will also use Effect for error handling, allowing for composable error handling and recovery.

Testing will include unit tests for the Field implementation, covering various data types, validation scenarios, and error cases. We will also test integration with Zod and Effect to ensure proper functionality.

## Components Involved
- Core primitives
- Type validation
- Error handling
- Effect integration
- Zod integration

## Dependencies
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Effect library
- Zod library
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define the Field interface
  - [ ] Define type property using Zod types
  - [ ] Define description property
  - [ ] Define required property
  - [ ] Define default value property
  - [ ] Define validate method
- [ ] Implement Field factory function
  - [ ] Create function that returns a Field instance
  - [ ] Handle options for required and default values
  - [ ] Ensure proper typing with generics
- [ ] Implement validation logic
  - [ ] Integrate with Zod for type validation
  - [ ] Handle undefined values based on required flag
  - [ ] Apply default values when appropriate
  - [ ] Create descriptive error messages
- [ ] Implement Effect integration
  - [ ] Use Effect for validation results
  - [ ] Define ValidationError type
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling
- [ ] Create utility functions
  - [ ] Create common field types (String, Number, Boolean, etc.)
  - [ ] Create functions for array and object fields
  - [ ] Create functions for custom validation rules
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Test basic validation for different types
  - [ ] Test optional fields and default values
  - [ ] Test error cases and messages
  - [ ] Test integration with Effect

## Verification Steps
1. Run unit tests with `npm run test src/core/field.test.ts`
2. Verify test coverage with `npm run test:coverage`
3. Run type checking with `npm run typecheck`
4. Run linting with `npm run lint`
5. Create a simple example that uses the Field type and verify it works as expected
6. Verify that the Field implementation matches the Python DSPy equivalent functionality

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Implementation details of the Field type
  - Error message formatting
  - Test organization
  - Utility functions for common field types

- Requires user input:
  - Any deviations from Python DSPy's Field behavior
  - Additional features not present in Python DSPy
  - Changes to the core Field interface

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- Should we exactly match Python DSPy's Field API or adapt it to be more TypeScript-idiomatic?
- How should we handle complex nested types that may not be fully representable in Zod?

### Non-blocking
- Exact error message formatting can be refined over time
- Additional utility functions can be added as needed
- Performance optimizations can be implemented later

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may start with support for basic types and add more complex types later
- Initial implementation may not handle all edge cases that will be discovered during testing
- We may defer implementing some advanced validation features until needed
- Documentation may be minimal initially, focusing on API reference

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The Field implementation should be designed to be extensible for future enhancements
- We should prioritize type safety and clear error messages
- The implementation should be as close as possible to Python DSPy while leveraging TypeScript's type system
- We should consider performance implications of validation, especially for complex objects
