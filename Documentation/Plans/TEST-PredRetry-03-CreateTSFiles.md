# Workplan: Create TypeScript Test Files for Retry Logic

## Task ID
TEST-PredRetry-03-CreateTSFiles

## Problem Statement
Create the basic structure for TypeScript test files for retry logic, using Vitest, with placeholder tests based on the Python test analysis.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create `tests/predict/Retry.test.ts` (or integrate into `Predict.test.ts` or `LM.test.ts` if retry is part of those).
- Set up `describe` blocks for retry functionalities (e.g., "Basic Retries", "Retry with Backoff", "Max Retries Exceeded").
- Create placeholder `it` functions for each corresponding Python test.

## Components Involved
- `tests/predict/Retry.test.ts` (new or existing file).
- Vitest.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredRetry-02-AnalyzeStructure`.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create or identify the target test file for retry logic.
- [ ] Add top-level `describe('Retry Logic', () => { /* ... */ });`.
- [ ] Create nested `describe` blocks.
- [ ] For each Python retry test, create a placeholder `it('should ...', () => { /* Placeholder */ });`.
- [ ] Ensure placeholders initially fail or are skipped.

## Verification Steps
- Test file structure for retry logic is in place.
- Running tests shows new placeholders.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Grouping can be refined.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Placeholders are sufficient.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This creates the test skeleton for retry logic.
