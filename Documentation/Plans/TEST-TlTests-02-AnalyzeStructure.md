# Workplan: Analyze Tool Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-TlTests-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns in Python tests for `dspy.Tool`, focusing on how tool definition, argument parsing/validation, execution (sync/async), and error handling are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python `Tool` test.
- Document patterns for:
    - Defining tools with functions and metadata.
    - Testing tool execution with various arguments.
    - Asserting argument validation (e.g., using Pydantic models in Python).
    - Testing error handling during tool execution.
- Identify Python-specific features (e.g., `inspect` for arg parsing) and challenges for TypeScript (where explicit schemas like Zod will be used).

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `Tool` test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TlTests-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python `Tool` test:
    - Document core assertions.
    - Note how `Tool` instances are created and how their wrapped functions are defined.
    - Identify how argument schemas are defined/inferred and tested.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `Tool` features.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures used.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TypeScript/Effect/Zod conversion.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python `Tool` test patterns.
- Conversion challenges, especially around argument schema definition, are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- How Python's `inspect` based argument parsing is tested and how this translates to Zod-based schemas in TS.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `Tool`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis guides the TypeScript test implementation for `Tool`.
