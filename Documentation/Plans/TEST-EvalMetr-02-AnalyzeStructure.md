# Workplan: Analyze Evaluation Metrics Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-EvalMetr-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for evaluation metrics. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how `Example` and `Prediction` objects are constructed and how metric outcomes are asserted.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for evaluation metrics from `TEST-EvalMetr-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking boolean results for match metrics, comparing numerical scores).
- Identify how Python's features are used and how these might translate to TypeScript/Vitest.
- Note any dependencies on other DSPy components (like `Example`, `Prediction`).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python evaluation metrics test cases from `dspy/tests/evaluate/test_metrics.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-EvalMetr-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for evaluation metrics).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python evaluation metrics test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made.
    - [ ] Note how `Example` and `Prediction` instances are created and populated for the test.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific features.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for different types of metrics.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used in the Python tests.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python evaluation metrics tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how normalization (e.g., `normalize_text`) is applied within metrics and tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to core metric calculations.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and any necessary helper utilities for evaluation metrics.
