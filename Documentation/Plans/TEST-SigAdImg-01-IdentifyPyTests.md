# Workplan: Identify Python Adapter Image Handling Tests

## Task ID
TEST-SigAdImg-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
To understand how image handling within signatures and adapters is tested in Python DSPy, we must first comprehensively identify all relevant Python test cases from `dspy/tests/signatures/test_adapter_image.py`.

## Proposed Implementation
- Access the Python DSPy repository.
- Navigate to `dspy/tests/signatures/test_adapter_image.py`.
- List all test functions (e.g., `test_basic_image_operations`, `test_image_input_formats`).
- For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding `dspy.Image` type, its instantiation, encoding, and usage in signatures/adapters.
- Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (`dspy/tests/signatures/test_adapter_image.py`)
- Analysis documentation (this workplan and its outputs)

## Dependencies
- Parent Epic: `../../docs/planning/workplans/TEST-SignaturesAdapterImageTests.md`
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Review `dspy/tests/signatures/test_adapter_image.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions in this file.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against `dspy/tests/signatures/test_adapter_image.py` to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding interactions with PIL (Pillow) library and requests for image data.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on `test_adapter_image.py`.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task is the first step in analyzing tests for image handling.
