# Workplan: Document LM Client Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliLM-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `LM` client component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing other client integrations or modules that use LMs.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `LM.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking LiteLLM calls, `DummyLM.ts`), common assertion patterns for LM responses, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing asynchronous calls and error handling.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `LM` configurations (caching, retries, model types) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/LM.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliLM-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `LM` client tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `LM.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to mock LiteLLM API calls or use `DummyLM.ts`.
    - Patterns for testing different LM configurations (chat/text, caching, retries).
    - Testing asynchronous LM calls (especially if Effectful).
    - Asserting LM responses and error conditions.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `LM` client tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `LM` client testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps in testing modules that depend on `LM` clients.
