# DSTyS Spikes

This directory contains documentation for all spikes conducted as part of the DSTyS project.

## What is a Spike?

A spike is a time-boxed investigation aimed at reducing uncertainty, evaluating alternatives, or gathering information needed to refine a workplan. Spikes are used when:
- There is significant technical uncertainty about how to implement a feature
- Multiple implementation approaches need to be evaluated
- The scope or complexity of a task is unclear
- New technologies or libraries need to be assessed
- Performance or scalability concerns need to be investigated

## Spike Documentation Structure

Each spike is documented in a separate markdown file with the naming convention `SPIKE-[Identifier].md`. The documentation follows a standard template that includes:

- **Investigation Objective**: Clear statement of what the spike aims to discover
- **Investigation Approach**: Methodology for conducting the spike
- **Areas of Focus**: Specific aspects to investigate
- **Evaluation Criteria**: How to determine if the spike was successful
- **Documentation Requirements**: What should be recorded during the spike
- **Review Process**: How spike results will be evaluated
- **Time Box**: Maximum time allocated for the spike
- **Related Workplans**: Workplans that will be informed by this spike
- **Status**: Current state of the spike (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- **Findings**: Summary of discoveries and recommendations

## Creating a New Spike

To create a new spike:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory with the naming convention `SPIKE-[Identifier].md`
2. Use the template provided in the `.cursor/rules/spikes.mdc` file
3. Fill in all required sections of the template
4. Link the spike to related workplans
5. Update the status as the spike progresses

## Spike Code Management

Code created during spikes should:
- Be stored in a dedicated branch with a naming convention of `spike/[identifier]`
- Include clear documentation explaining its purpose and limitations
- Not be merged directly into the main codebase without review
- Be referenced in the spike documentation

## Spike Review Process

All completed spikes should undergo a review process that includes:
- Presentation of findings to relevant stakeholders
- Validation of recommendations against project goals
- Agreement on implementation approach based on findings
- Updating of related workplans
- Documentation of decisions made based on spike results

## Spike Index

Below is an index of all spikes in the project:

| Spike ID | Objective | Status | Related Workplans |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| *No spikes yet* | | | |

*This index will be updated as new spikes are created.*
