# Epic Overview: Reliability Generated Tests Conversion (TEST-ReliabilityGeneratedTests)

## Task ID
TEST-ReliabilityGeneratedTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To ensure DSTyS programs handle diverse and complex inputs reliably across different models, we need to analyze the Python DSPy reliability tests that use generated test cases (from `dspy/tests/reliability/test_generated.py`) and adapt this testing strategy for DSTyS.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
The process involves understanding and adapting the generated test case strategy.
1.  Analyze Python `test_generated.py` and the `dspy/tests/reliability/generate/` utilities to understand how test programs, inputs, and assertions are generated and executed.
2.  Determine how this generation and execution process can be replicated or adapted for DSTyS. This might involve:
    *   Porting the test case generation logic to TypeScript.
    *   Using existing Python-generated test cases (JSON inputs/assertions) with DSTyS programs.
3.  If porting tests:
    *   Re-implement conceptual test equivalents in TypeScript using Vitest.
    *   Focus on running DSTyS programs (equivalents of the Python generated programs) with the generated inputs and validating outputs against generated assertions using a judge LM.
The outcome will be a strategy for robust, generative testing of DSTyS programs.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Python test file: `dspy/tests/reliability/test_generated.py` and `dspy/tests/reliability/generate/`
- DSTyS component: Test execution harness for generated cases, potentially DSTyS versions of generated programs.
- Vitest testing framework
- Judge LM for validating assertions.

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure
- SETUP-DependencyManagement
- TEST-Framework
- TEST-ConversionTemplate
- Core DSTyS primitives and modules.
- A reliable judge LM setup.

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-RelGen-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Reliability Generated tests
- [TEST-RelGen-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure
- [TEST-RelGen-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TS test files
- [TEST-RelGen-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TS/Effect
- [TEST-RelGen-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mocks (for judge LM, generated programs)
- [TEST-RelGen-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify coverage (of test harness)
- [TEST-RelGen-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-RelGen-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent: Design of test harness.
- User Input: Strategy for test case generation (port generator vs. use Python-generated files).

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)
### Blocking
- Complexity of porting the test case generation logic if chosen.
- Setting up a reliable judge LM for assertion validation.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- Initially, might use a subset of Python-generated test cases with manually ported DSTyS equivalent programs.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
These tests are crucial for assessing cross-model reliability and robustness.
