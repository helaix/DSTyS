# Workplan: Document Adapter Image Handling Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-SigAdImg-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document patterns used in testing image handling within signatures and adapters.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review `AdapterImage.test.ts`.
- Document:
    - How `Image` objects are created from different sources (URL, file, buffer) in tests.
    - How mock image data is managed.
    - Patterns for testing adapter formatting of messages with images.
    - Asserting image data in formatted prompts.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/signatures/AdapterImage.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-SigAdImg-06-VerifyCoverage`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `AdapterImage.test.ts`.
- [ ] Document testing patterns for image handling.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps

- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
