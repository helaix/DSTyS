# Epic Overview: Tool Tests Conversion (TEST-ToolTests)

## Task ID
TEST-ToolTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the Tool class to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. These tests will serve as the specification for the Tool implementation and ensure feature parity with the Python version while leveraging TypeScript's type system and Effect's functional programming patterns.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will convert the Python tests for the Tool class to TypeScript, adapting them to work with the TypeScript type system and Effect TS patterns. The process involves:
1. Analyzing Python Tool tests (tool definition, execution, argument parsing, error handling).
2. Re-implementing these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3. Adapting test logic for TypeScript's static typing, Effect TS patterns (for tool execution), and Zod schema for argument validation.
4. Creating necessary mocks for wrapped functions.
The converted tests will guide the `CORE-ToolImplementation`.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Vitest testing framework
- TypeScript test files for `Tool`
- Mocks for wrapped functions
- Effect TS and Zod testing patterns

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (Vitest setup, Effect test utilities)
- TEST-ConversionTemplate (guidelines for test conversion)
- CORE-ModuleImplementation (if Tool is a Module or used by Modules)

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-TlTests-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Tool tests
- [TEST-TlTests-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure and patterns
- [TEST-TlTests-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TypeScript test files
- [TEST-TlTests-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TypeScript & Effect
- [TEST-TlTests-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mock implementations
- [TEST-TlTests-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify test coverage
- [TEST-TlTests-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-TlTests-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document test patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Test file organization and naming.
  - Test utility implementation details.
  - Mock implementation details.
  - TypeScript-specific test adaptations.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python test coverage.
  - Additional test cases not present in Python version.
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Tool.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's tool execution in TypeScript, especially argument parsing and schema definition?
- How should we integrate Effect TS patterns for handling tool execution (sync/async, errors)?

### Non-blocking
- Exact test organization can be refined over time.
- Test utility implementation details can be adjusted based on experience.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- We may need to adapt some Python test patterns to work better with TypeScript.
- Argument schema definition in TypeScript will likely be more explicit (e.g., using Zod) than Python's introspection.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The Tool class is important for agentic behaviors; its tests are critical.
- Test conversion should focus on maintaining functional equivalence for tool definition, execution, and error handling.
