# Epic Overview: Field Tests Conversion (TEST-FieldTests)

## Task ID
TEST-FieldTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the Field type to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. These tests will serve as the specification for the Field implementation and ensure feature parity with the Python version while leveraging TypeScript's type system and Effect's functional programming patterns.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will convert the Python tests for the Field type to TypeScript, adapting them to work with the TypeScript type system and Effect TS patterns. The process involves:
1. Analyzing Python Field tests.
2. Re-implementing these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3. Adapting test logic for TypeScript's static typing and Effect TS patterns.
4. Creating necessary mocks or test utilities.
The converted tests will guide the `CORE-FieldImplementation`.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Vitest testing framework
- TypeScript test files for `Field`
- Mocks for dependencies
- Effect TS testing patterns

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (must be completed first)
- TEST-ConversionTemplate (must be completed first)

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-FldTests-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Field tests
- [TEST-FldTests-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure and patterns
- [TEST-FldTests-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TypeScript test files
- [TEST-FldTests-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TypeScript & Effect
- [TEST-FldTests-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mock implementations
- [TEST-FldTests-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify test coverage
- [TEST-FldTests-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-FldTests-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document test patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Test file organization and naming
  - Test utility implementation details
  - Mock implementation details
  - TypeScript-specific test adaptations

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python test coverage
  - Additional test cases not present in Python version
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Field

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's dynamic typing patterns in TypeScript?
- How should we integrate Effect TS patterns for error handling in tests?
- Should we use Zod schemas directly in tests or create abstractions?

### Non-blocking
- Exact test organization can be refined over time
- Test utility implementation details can be adjusted based on experience
- Additional test cases can be added as needed

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- We may need to adapt some Python test patterns to work better with TypeScript
- Initial test coverage may not be 100% identical to Python version
- Some Python-specific features may need different approaches in TypeScript
- We may need to create additional test utilities not present in the Python version

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The Field type is a fundamental building block of the library, so its tests are critical.
- The test conversion should focus on maintaining functional equivalence while leveraging TypeScript features.
- Effect TS integration is a key aspect of the TypeScript implementation.
- These tests will serve as a model for converting other component tests.
