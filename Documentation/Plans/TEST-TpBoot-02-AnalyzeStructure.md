# Workplan: Analyze BootstrapFewShot Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-TpBoot-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how student/teacher module interactions, demo generation, and metric evaluations are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for `BootstrapFewShot` from `TEST-TpBoot-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking compiled student's demos, verifying metric scores, testing error handling during compilation).
- Identify how Python's features are used and how these might translate to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.
- Note any dependencies on other DSPy components (like `Module`, `Predict`, `Example`, metric functions).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `BootstrapFewShot` test cases from `dspy/tests/teleprompt/test_bootstrap.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TpBoot-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for `BootstrapFewShot`).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python `BootstrapFewShot` test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made.
    - [ ] Note how `BootstrapFewShot` instances, student/teacher modules, trainsets, and metrics are set up.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific features.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `BootstrapFewShot` features.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used in the Python tests.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python `BootstrapFewShot` tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how the "teacher" module's predictions are used to generate demos.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `BootstrapFewShot`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and any necessary helper utilities for the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer.
