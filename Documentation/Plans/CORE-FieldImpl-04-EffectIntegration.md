# Workplan: Field Effect Integration for Error Handling

## Task ID
CORE-FieldImpl-04-EffectIntegration

## Problem Statement
Integrate the Effect library for robust error handling in `Field`-related operations, primarily for the validation process. This ensures that failures are handled in a structured, type-safe, and composable manner.

## Proposed Implementation
- Define custom error types for field operations, specifically `FieldValidationError`, using `Data.TaggedError`. This error type should be capable of holding details from Zod validation failures.
- Ensure that any `Field` method that can fail (like `validate`) returns an `Effect.Effect<SuccessType, ErrorType>`, where `ErrorType` includes `FieldValidationError`.
- Refrain from throwing exceptions directly in these methods; instead, use `Effect.fail` with the appropriate custom error.
- Testing: Unit tests should cover scenarios where field operations succeed and fail, verifying that the correct `Effect` (Success or Failure with the tagged error) is returned.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Field.ts`
- Effect library (`Effect`, `Data.TaggedError`)

## Dependencies
- `CORE-FieldImpl-01-TypeDef` (base Field definition)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define `FieldValidationError extends Data.TaggedError<{ originalError?: Zod.ZodError, message: string }>` (or similar structure).
- [ ] Review methods in `Field.ts` (especially `validate` if implemented in `CORE-FieldImpl-03-ZodIntegration`) and ensure they return `Effect.Effect`.
- [ ] Replace any direct exception throwing with `Effect.fail(new FieldValidationError(...))`.
- [ ] Write unit tests specifically for Effect-based error handling:
    - Test that successful validation returns `Effect.Success` with the parsed value.
    - Test that failed validation returns `Effect.Failure` with a `FieldValidationError` containing relevant details.

## Verification Steps
- Run unit tests for `Field.ts` focusing on Effect integration.
- Confirm that methods like `validate` correctly use `Effect.succeed` and `Effect.fail`.
- Verify that `FieldValidationError` instances are correctly constructed and returned.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: The exact structure and properties of `FieldValidationError`.
- User Input: None anticipated for this core integration.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- Ensuring the `FieldValidationError` captures enough detail from Zod's errors to be useful for debugging by users.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- The `FieldValidationError` might initially carry a simple message, with more structured Zod error data added iteratively.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Consistent use of Effect for error handling is crucial for the overall robustness and composability of the DSTyS library.
