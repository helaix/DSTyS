# Epic Overview: Callback System Tests Conversion (TEST-CallbackTests)

## Task ID
TEST-CallbackTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To ensure the DSTyS callback system functions correctly, allowing users to hook into various stages of module execution, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for callbacks (from `dspy/tests/callback/test_callback.py`) to TypeScript.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
The process involves converting Python tests for the callback system to TypeScript.
1.  Analyze Python `test_callback.py` to understand how callbacks are registered, triggered, and what data they receive.
2.  Re-implement these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3.  Adapt test logic for TypeScript's type system and any Effect TS patterns used in the callback mechanism or module execution.
4.  Create mock modules and callback handlers for testing.
The converted tests will guide the implementation of the DSTyS callback system.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Python test file: `dspy/tests/callback/test_callback.py`
- DSTyS component: Callback registration, triggering logic within `Module` execution, `BaseCallback` interface.
- Vitest testing framework
- Effect TS testing patterns

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure
- SETUP-DependencyManagement
- TEST-Framework
- TEST-ConversionTemplate
- Core DSTyS `Module` implementation.

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent: Design of mock callbacks.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)
### Blocking
- The exact mechanism for callback registration and invocation in DSTyS.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- Initial tests might cover core callback events, with more specific event tests added later.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
A robust callback system is important for observability and extensibility.
