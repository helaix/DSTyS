# Epic Overview: Databricks Client Tests Conversion (TEST-ClientsDatabricksTests)

## Task ID
TEST-ClientsDatabricksTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To ensure the DSTyS Databricks LM client functions correctly, including finetuning and deployment capabilities, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the Databricks client (from `dspy/tests/clients/test_databricks.py`) to TypeScript.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
The process involves converting Python tests for the Databricks client to TypeScript.
1.  Analyze Python `test_databricks.py` to understand test scenarios for client instantiation, API calls, finetuning job creation, and model deployment.
2.  Re-implement these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3.  Adapt test logic for TypeScript's type system and Effect TS patterns for asynchronous operations and error handling.
4.  Create extensive mocks for Databricks SDK calls and API responses, as live testing against Databricks is often restricted.
The converted tests will guide the implementation of the DSTyS Databricks client.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Python test file: `dspy/tests/clients/test_databricks.py`
- DSTyS component: `DatabricksLM.ts` client.
- Vitest testing framework
- Effect TS testing patterns
- Mocks for Databricks SDK/APIs.

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure
- SETUP-DependencyManagement
- TEST-Framework
- TEST-ConversionTemplate
- Core DSTyS `LM` interface.

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-CliDBX-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Databricks tests
- [TEST-CliDBX-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure
- [TEST-CliDBX-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TS test files
- [TEST-CliDBX-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TS/Effect
- [TEST-CliDBX-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mocks
- [TEST-CliDBX-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify coverage
- [TEST-CliDBX-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-CliDBX-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent: Design of Databricks API mocks.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)
### Blocking
- Complexity of mocking Databricks finetuning and deployment APIs.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- Initial tests might focus on core LM interaction, with finetuning/deployment tests being more mock-heavy or deferred if too complex.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Testing LM provider integrations requires careful mocking.
