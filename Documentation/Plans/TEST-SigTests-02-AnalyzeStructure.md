# Workplan: Analyze Signature Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-SigTests-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns in Python tests for `dspy.Signature`, focusing on how string-based and class-based definitions, field management, instruction handling, and validation are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python `Signature` test.
- Document patterns for:
    - Testing string-based signature parsing.
    - Testing class-based signature definition (metaclass behavior).
    - Asserting `input_fields`, `output_fields`, `instructions`.
    - Testing signature manipulation methods.
    - Testing validation logic (if any directly in `Signature` tests).
- Identify Python-specific features (metaclasses, dynamic attribute access) and challenges for TypeScript.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `Signature` test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-SigTests-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python `Signature` test:
    - Document core assertions.
    - Note how `Signature` instances are created (string, class).
    - Identify Python-specific features used (e.g., metaclass for class-based signatures).
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `Signature` features.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures used.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TypeScript/Effect conversion, especially for class-based signatures.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python `Signature` test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- How Python's metaclass-driven class-based signatures are tested.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `Signature`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis guides the TypeScript test implementation for `Signature`.
