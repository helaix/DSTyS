# Workplan: Document Inspect History Utility Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliInspH-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `inspect_history` utility. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar utilities that interact with global state or produce console output.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `InspectHistory.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for populating global LM history, capturing console output), common assertion patterns for console output, or specific ways Vitest spies were used.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different `inspect_history` scenarios (empty history, specific `n` values) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/InspectHistory.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliInspH-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `inspect_history` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `InspectHistory.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up and clear global LM history for tests.
    - How to capture and assert console output using `vi.spyOn(console, 'log')`.
    - Patterns for testing different `n` values and edge cases like empty history.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `inspect_history` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `inspect_history` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test utilities interacting with global state or console.
