# Workplan: Verify Signature Custom Types Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-SigCustTy-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Ensure that tests for custom type handling in signatures adequately cover the relevant logic in `Signature.ts` and `Field.ts` (specifically how Zod schemas or class types are stored, resolved, and used for validation).

## Proposed Implementation
- After custom type handling in signatures is implemented and tests pass:
    - Run `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for parts of `Signature.ts` and `Field.ts` related to custom type processing and Zod schema integration.
    - Identify untested scenarios or logic branches.
    - Write additional tests if necessary.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Signature.ts`, `source/signatures/Field.ts`.
- `tests/signatures/CustomTypes.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-SignatureCustomTypesImpl` (Conceptual implementation task).
- All custom type tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure custom type handling in `Signature`/`Field` is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for relevant sections of `Signature.ts` and `Field.ts`.
- [ ] If significant gaps related to custom type handling exist, add tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows good coverage for logic handling custom types and Zod schemas in `Signature` and `Field`.
- Various custom type scenarios (objects, arrays, enums, nested) are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on coverage of how `Signature` and `Field` integrate with Zod for custom types.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures robust handling of complex, user-defined data structures.
