## Notes on Using This Template

This Workplan template is designed to provide detailed implementation instructions for each chunk identified in the Project Overview. It follows the process outlined in the issue:

1. Select chunks from Project Overview
2. Break down each chunk into detailed tasks
3. Define technical specifications for each task
4. Develop testing strategies
5. Create implementation guidance
6. Define review criteria

When using this template:

1. **Start with the Project Overview**: Review the Project Overview document to understand how this chunk fits into the overall project.
2. **Be specific and detailed**: Provide enough detail that a developer can implement the chunk without needing to ask many questions.
3. **Include all necessary technical specifications**: Diagrams, data models, API specifications, etc.
4. **Define clear testing criteria**: Ensure that the implementation can be properly tested and verified.
5. **Provide helpful guidance**: Include best practices, code examples, and potential challenges.
6. **Set clear review criteria**: Define what a successful implementation looks like.

Remember that a good Workplan should:
- Provide clear, actionable tasks
- Include detailed technical specifications
- Define comprehensive testing strategies
- Offer practical implementation guidance
- Establish objective review criteria
