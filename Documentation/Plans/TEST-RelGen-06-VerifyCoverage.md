# Workplan: Verify Reliability Generated Test Harness Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-RelGen-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the reliability generated test harness (`Generated.test.ts` and its helper functions like `assertProgramOutputCorrectTS`) is implemented, verify its code coverage.

## Proposed Implementation
- After the test harness implementation is complete and tests (using mock programs/judge) pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for `tests/reliability/Generated.test.ts` (if it contains significant logic) and any helper utilities (e.g., `assertProgramOutputCorrectTS` if in a separate file).
    - Identify untested parts of the harness logic.
    - Write additional tests for the harness itself if necessary.

## Components Involved
- `tests/reliability/Generated.test.ts`.
- Helper files for the harness.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RelGen-04-AdaptTests` (Harness implemented).
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure harness implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for harness-specific logic.
- [ ] If significant logic in the harness is untested, add tests for it.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows good coverage for any complex logic within the test harness itself.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Coverage focus is on the harness logic, not the generated programs themselves (their correctness is judged by the judge LM).

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures the test execution and validation mechanism is robust.
