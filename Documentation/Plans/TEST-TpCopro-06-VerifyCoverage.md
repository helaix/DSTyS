# Workplan: Verify COPRO Optimizer Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-TpCopro-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the `COPRO.ts` optimizer is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves the target code coverage for this optimizer.

## Proposed Implementation
- After the `COPRO` optimizer implementation is complete and all tests in `TEST-TpCopro-04-AdaptTests` (and any subsequently added tests) are passing:
    - Run the test suite with coverage reporting enabled (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Analyze the coverage report specifically for `source/teleprompt/COPRO.ts`.
    - Identify any untested lines, branches, or functions within the optimizer logic (e.g., instruction generation loops, metric evaluation, candidate selection).
    - Write additional tests to cover these gaps, if critical, aiming for >85-90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/teleprompt/COPRO.ts` (the implementation).
- `tests/teleprompt/COPRO.test.ts` (the tests).
- Vitest coverage reporting tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-TelepromptCoproImplementation` (Full implementation of COPRO - conceptual name).
- All `COPRO` tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `COPRO` optimizer implementation is complete and all existing tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine the coverage report for `source/teleprompt/COPRO.ts`.
- [ ] If coverage is below target (e.g., 85%):
    - [ ] Identify specific lines/branches not covered.
    - [ ] Write new test cases in `COPRO.test.ts` to cover these gaps.
    - [ ] Re-run coverage until target is met or remaining gaps are justified as non-critical.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows target coverage (e.g., >85%) for the `COPRO` optimizer.
- All critical paths and functionalities of `COPRO` are covered by tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Writing additional tests.
- User Input: Acceptance of any coverage gaps if 100% is not feasible/practical.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None, assuming implementation and basic tests are done.

### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex error handling or edge cases in the optimization loop.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May accept slightly below 100% coverage if the remaining uncovered code is trivial or involves highly complex interactions.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good test coverage ensures the `COPRO` optimizer is reliable.
