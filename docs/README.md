## Software Development Workflow

The DSTy project follows a comprehensive software development workflow as outlined in the [master issue](https://linear.app/helaix/issue/HLX-1401/software-development-workflow-template-master-issue). This workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: Define what you're building and why
2. **Architecture Document**: Define how you'll build it
3. **UX/UI Plan** (Optional): Define the user experience and interface
4. **Project Overview**: Break down the project into implementable chunks
5. **Workplans**: Create detailed implementation instructions for each chunk
6. **Rules**: Set up AI assistant rules and prompts
7. **Spikes**: Investigate, evaluate, and refine workplans before implementation
8. **Reviews**: Ensure code quality and identify issues
