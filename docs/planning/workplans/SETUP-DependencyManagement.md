# SETUP-DependencyManagement

## Task ID
SETUP-DependencyManagement

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS project requires proper dependency management to ensure consistent builds, efficient development workflows, and proper package configuration. We need to set up the package.json file with all necessary dependencies, configure module resolution and exports, and set up bundling and publishing configurations.

## Proposed Implementation
We will set up a comprehensive dependency management system for the DSTyS project, including:

1. Package.json configuration with all necessary dependencies
2. Module resolution and exports configuration
3. Bundling setup for different target environments
4. Publishing configuration for npm or other registries
5. Version management and release workflow

The implementation will focus on using modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, including:
- Using ESM modules as the primary module format
- Configuring TypeScript for proper module resolution
- Setting up bundling with tools like tsup or esbuild
- Configuring package exports for different environments (ESM, CJS, browser)
- Setting up dependency management with proper versioning

We will ensure that all dependencies are properly specified with appropriate version ranges, and that the package.json file includes all necessary metadata for publishing.

## Components Involved
- Package.json configuration
- Module resolution and exports
- Bundling and publishing
- Version management
- Dependency specification

## Dependencies
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Effect library
- Zod library
- Bundling tools (tsup, esbuild, or similar)
- Package management tools (npm, yarn, or pnpm)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Configure package.json
  - [ ] Set up basic metadata (name, version, description, etc.)
  - [ ] Configure license and author information
  - [ ] Set up repository and homepage links
  - [ ] Configure package keywords
- [ ] Set up dependencies
  - [ ] Add Effect as a dependency
  - [ ] Add Zod as a dependency
  - [ ] Add other runtime dependencies
  - [ ] Configure development dependencies
  - [ ] Configure peer dependencies if needed
- [ ] Configure module resolution
  - [ ] Set up module type (ESM)
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript module resolution
  - [ ] Set up path aliases
- [ ] Configure package exports
  - [ ] Set up main entry point
  - [ ] Configure ESM exports
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript type definitions
  - [ ] Set up conditional exports for different environments
- [ ] Set up bundling
  - [ ] Choose and configure bundling tool
  - [ ] Set up build scripts
  - [ ] Configure output formats
  - [ ] Set up minification and optimization
- [ ] Configure publishing
  - [ ] Set up npm publishing configuration
  - [ ] Configure files to include/exclude
  - [ ] Set up version management
  - [ ] Configure release workflow

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm install` to verify dependency installation works correctly
2. Run `npm run build` to verify the build process works
3. Verify that all dependencies are properly resolved
4. Check that module resolution works correctly
5. Verify that the package can be imported in different environments
6. Run a test publish to verify publishing configuration
7. Verify that version management works correctly

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Specific dependency versions
  - Bundling tool selection
  - Module resolution configuration
  - Build script implementation

- Requires user input:
  - Package name and organization
  - Publishing strategy
  - Version management strategy
  - Major dependency choices

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- What should be the package name and organization scope?
- Should we publish to npm or use a private registry?
- What should be our versioning strategy (semver, etc.)?

### Non-blocking
- Specific dependency versions can be adjusted as needed
- Bundling configuration can be refined over time
- Module resolution details can be adjusted based on project needs

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may start with a simpler bundling configuration and enhance it over time
- Initial publishing setup may be basic, focusing on npm only
- We may defer setting up complex conditional exports until needed
- Performance optimizations for the build process can be implemented later

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The dependency management should be designed to accommodate future growth
- We should prioritize developer experience and ease of contribution
- The bundling system should be optimized for both development and production use cases
- We should consider using modern tools like changesets for version management
