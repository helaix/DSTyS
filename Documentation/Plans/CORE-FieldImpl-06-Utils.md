# Workplan: Create Field Utility Functions

## Task ID
CORE-FieldImpl-06-Utils

## Problem Statement
Develop utility functions for working with `Field` objects, if necessary. This could include helpers for common tasks like comparing fields, serializing/deserializing field definitions (distinct from field *values*), or transforming field metadata. Python DSPy's `Field` is primarily a metadata container; extensive utilities might not be needed if Zod and direct property access suffice.

## Proposed Implementation
- Evaluate the need for utility functions beyond direct property access and Zod schema methods.
- Potential utilities:
    - `isInputField(field: Field<any>): field is InputField<any>` (if using type guards for differentiation).
    - `isOutputField(field: Field<any>): field is OutputField<any>`.
    - `compareFields(fieldA: Field<any>, fieldB: Field<any>): boolean` (for structural or metadata comparison).
    - `serializeFieldDefinition(field: Field<any>): SerializedFieldDef` (if needed for saving/loading signature structures, separate from Zod schema serialization).
    - `deserializeFieldDefinition(data: SerializedFieldDef): Field<any>`.
- Implement identified utilities with clear APIs and JSDoc.
- Testing: Write unit tests for each utility function, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Field.utils.ts` (new file, or methods within `Field.ts`)

## Dependencies
- `CORE-FieldImpl-01-TypeDef` (base Field definition)
- `CORE-FieldImpl-02-InputOutput` (InputField/OutputField differentiation)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Assess the necessity of specific utility functions for `Field` objects.
- [ ] If utilities are needed, define their signatures and implement them.
    - Consider type guards `isInputField`, `isOutputField`.
    - Consider comparison or transformation utilities if complex metadata handling is anticipated.
- [ ] Write unit tests for all implemented utility functions.
- [ ] Document all utility functions with JSDoc.

## Verification Steps
- Run unit tests for field utility functions.
- Ensure utilities perform as expected and handle edge cases correctly.
- Code review for clarity, correctness, and necessity of the utilities.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific implementation of utilities.
- User Input: Prioritization of which utilities, if any, are most critical based on anticipated use cases in `Signature` and `Predict` modules.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Determining if such utilities are genuinely needed or if direct Zod/property access is sufficient for most operations.

### Non-blocking
- The exact set of utilities can evolve as the library develops.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Opt for fewer utilities if the `Field` object's direct API and Zod's capabilities cover most needs, to keep the API surface minimal.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
The goal is to provide helpful, non-obtrusive utilities. Over-engineering utilities that are rarely used should be avoided.
