# Workplan: Create TypeScript Test Files for Callback System

## Task ID
TEST-Callback-03-CreateTSFiles

## Problem Statement
Create the basic structure for TypeScript test files for the Callback System component, using Vitest. This involves setting up `describe` blocks and placeholder `test` cases based on the analysis of Python tests.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create a new test file, e.g., `tests/utils/Callback.test.ts` (or similar path).
- Based on the analysis from `TEST-Callback-02-AnalyzeStructure`, create `describe` blocks for different aspects of Callback System functionality (e.g., "Callback Registration", "Event Triggering", "Data Payloads", "Error Handling in Callbacks").
- Within these blocks, create placeholder `test` (or `it`) functions for each corresponding Python test case. Name them descriptively.
- Import necessary Vitest functions (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`).

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/Callback.test.ts` (new file, or similar path).
- Vitest testing framework.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Callback-02-AnalyzeStructure` (Analysis of Python test structure).
- `TEST-Framework` (Vitest setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `tests/utils/Callback.test.ts` (or similar path).
- [ ] Add top-level `describe('CallbackSystem', () => { /* ... */ });`.
- [ ] Create nested `describe` blocks for logical groupings of Callback System tests.
- [ ] For each identified Python Callback System test, create a corresponding `it('should ...', () => { expect(true).toBe(false); // Placeholder });` in the appropriate `describe` block.
- [ ] Ensure all placeholder tests initially fail or are skipped using `it.skip` or `it.todo`.

## Verification Steps
- The `Callback.test.ts` file exists and is correctly structured.
- Running `npm run test` (or equivalent) should show these new tests, likely failing or skipped.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Naming of `describe` and `it` blocks.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Exact grouping of tests can be refined later.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Placeholder tests are sufficient at this stage.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task creates the skeleton for the Callback System tests.
