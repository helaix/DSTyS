# TEST-ConversionTemplate

## Task ID
TEST-ConversionTemplate

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need a standardized process for converting Python DSPy tests to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. This requires creating templates, patterns, and utilities that can be consistently applied across all test conversions to ensure quality and consistency.

## Proposed Implementation
We will create a comprehensive template and set of utilities for converting Python DSPy tests to TypeScript, including:

1. A step-by-step process for analyzing and converting Python tests
2. Templates for different types of test conversions (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
3. Utilities for common testing patterns in TypeScript with Effect TS
4. Guidelines for handling Python-specific features in TypeScript
5. Documentation of the conversion process

The implementation will focus on:
- Creating a consistent approach to test conversion
- Handling the differences between Python's dynamic typing and TypeScript's static typing
- Integrating Effect TS patterns for handling effects and errors
- Providing utilities for common testing patterns
- Documenting the conversion process for future reference

We will create example conversions for different types of tests to serve as references for future conversions.

## Components Involved
- Test conversion process
- TypeScript testing patterns
- Effect TS integration
- Python to TypeScript translation
- Documentation

## Dependencies
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (must be completed first)
- Python DSPy codebase
- TypeScript and Effect TS knowledge

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Analyze Python test patterns
  - [ ] Identify common test patterns in DSPy
  - [ ] Categorize tests by type (unit, integration, etc.)
  - [ ] Identify Python-specific features used in tests
- [ ] Create conversion process
  - [ ] Define step-by-step process for test conversion
  - [ ] Create guidelines for handling Python-specific features
  - [ ] Define approach for handling dynamic typing
- [ ] Create templates
  - [ ] Create template for unit test conversion
  - [ ] Create template for integration test conversion
  - [ ] Create template for mock implementation
- [ ] Develop utilities
  - [ ] Create utilities for common testing patterns
  - [ ] Develop helpers for Effect TS integration
  - [ ] Create utilities for mocking and assertions
- [ ] Create example conversions
  - [ ] Convert a simple unit test as an example
  - [ ] Convert a complex test with mocking as an example
  - [ ] Convert a test with Effect TS integration as an example
- [ ] Document conversion process
  - [ ] Create detailed documentation of the conversion process
  - [ ] Document templates and utilities
  - [ ] Create examples and guidelines

## Verification Steps
1. Apply the conversion process to a simple Python test and verify the TypeScript test works
2. Apply the conversion process to a complex Python test and verify the TypeScript test works
3. Verify that the converted tests follow TypeScript and Effect TS best practices
4. Check that the conversion process is well-documented and easy to follow
5. Verify that the templates and utilities are reusable across different test conversions
6. Have another developer follow the process to convert a test and provide feedback

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Specific utility implementations
  - Template details
  - Documentation format
  - Example selection

- Requires user input:
  - Major changes to the conversion approach
  - Handling of complex Python features
  - Effect TS integration strategy

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's dynamic typing in TypeScript?
- What approach should we use for mocking in TypeScript?
- How should we integrate Effect TS in the testing process?

### Non-blocking
- Specific utility implementations can be refined over time
- Template details can be adjusted based on experience
- Documentation format can be improved as needed

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may not be able to directly translate all Python test patterns to TypeScript
- Some tests may require significant adaptation for TypeScript's type system
- Initial templates may be simpler and refined over time
- We may need to create TypeScript-specific tests for some features

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The conversion process should be designed to be followed by developers with varying levels of TypeScript experience
- We should prioritize clarity and consistency over direct translation
- The templates should be flexible enough to accommodate different testing needs
- We should consider the differences in testing philosophy between Python and TypeScript
