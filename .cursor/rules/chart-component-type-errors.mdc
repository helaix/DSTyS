# Known Type Errors: Chart Components

There are currently unresolved TypeScript errors (`TS2322: Type 'Element | null' is not assignable...`) in the following chart components:

- `[apps/web/src/components/chart-area-interactive.tsx](mdc:apps/web/src/components/chart-area-interactive.tsx)`
- `[apps/web/src/components/data-table.tsx](mdc:apps/web/src/components/data-table.tsx)`

These errors relate to conditional rendering of chart elements (like `<AreaChart>`). Standard fixes like changing `condition && <Component />` to `condition ? <Component /> : null` may not work if the parent container (e.g., `<ChartContainer>`, `<ScrollArea>`) requires a direct `ReactElement` child and does not accept `null`.

These errors require manual investigation and fixing, likely by adjusting the conditional rendering logic to ensure a valid `ReactElement` or an empty fragment (`<></>`) is always rendered where expected, or by conditionally rendering the parent container itself.
