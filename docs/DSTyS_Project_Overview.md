- Integrate with Effect library for robust error handling and functional programming patterns
- Provide a type-safe API with proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Support multiple foundation model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Implement comprehensive testing and evaluation framework
- Create detailed documentation and examples
- Build a community of contributors and users

### 1.4 Success Criteria
Success for the DSTyS project will be measured by:
