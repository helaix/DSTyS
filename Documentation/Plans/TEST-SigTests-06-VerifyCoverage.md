# Workplan: Verify Signature Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-SigTests-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `Signature.ts` is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves target code coverage for the `Signature` class.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `CORE-SignatureImplementation` is complete and `TEST-SigTests` pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for `source/signatures/Signature.ts`.
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests, aiming for >90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Signature.ts`.
- `tests/signatures/Signature.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-SigImpl-07-TestCompatibility` (All `Signature` tests passing).
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Signature.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/signatures/Signature.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 90%):
    - Identify uncovered lines/branches.
    - Add new tests in `Signature.test.ts`.
    - Re-run coverage.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows >90% for `Signature.ts`.
- All critical paths in `Signature` are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex parsing logic for string-based signatures.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
High coverage for `Signature` is vital as it defines module contracts.
