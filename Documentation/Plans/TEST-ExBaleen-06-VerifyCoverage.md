# Workplan: Verify Baleen Example Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-ExBaleen-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the Baleen example program (`SimplifiedBaleen.ts`) is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves adequate code coverage for this example module.

## Proposed Implementation
- After the `SimplifiedBaleen.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for `source/examples/SimplifiedBaleen.ts` (or its location).
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests if necessary, aiming for good coverage of the example's logic.

## Components Involved
- `source/examples/SimplifiedBaleen.ts`.
- `tests/examples/Baleen.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ExamplesBaleenImplementation` (Conceptual implementation task).
- All Baleen tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `SimplifiedBaleen.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/examples/SimplifiedBaleen.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 80-85% for an example program), add more tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows good coverage for `SimplifiedBaleen.ts`.
- Critical paths in the example program are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Coverage for example programs might be slightly lower than core library code if some parts are trivial glue code.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures the example program itself is well-tested.
