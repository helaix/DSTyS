# Workplan: Adapt ProgramOfThought Module Tests for TypeScript & Effect

## Task ID
TEST-PredPoT-04-AdaptTests

## Problem Statement
Convert the logic and assertions from the Python `ProgramOfThought` module tests into the placeholder TypeScript/Vitest test cases. This involves translating Python code to TypeScript, adapting for static typing, and integrating Effect TS patterns for LM calls and code execution.

## Proposed Implementation
- For each placeholder test in `tests/predict/ProgramOfThought.test.ts`:
    - Translate the corresponding Python test logic into TypeScript.
    - Define necessary input data (mock Signatures, LM responses for code generation) and expected outcomes.
    - Use `expect` assertions from Vitest.
    - Mock the code interpreter (e.g., a sandboxed JS eval or a mock Deno-like interface).
    - If `ProgramOfThought` methods return `Effect` objects, use `Effect.runPromiseExit` or helpers to test.
    - Ensure type safety in test code.

## Components Involved
- `tests/predict/ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.
- TypeScript, Vitest, Effect.
- Mock `Signature`, `LM`, and code interpreter.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredPoT-03-CreateTSFiles` (Placeholder test files).
- `TEST-PredPoT-05-CreateMocks` (Mocks for dependencies).
- Core DSTyS `ProgramOfThought`, `Signature`, `LM` class structures.
- A strategy for code execution (mocked or sandboxed).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Iterate through each placeholder test in `ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement the test logic based on the original Python test.
    - Set up `ProgramOfThought` instances with mock Signatures and LMs.
    - Mock LM responses to simulate code generation.
    - Mock the code interpreter to simulate execution of generated code and return results or errors.
    - Call `programOfThoughtModule.forward(...)`.
    - Assert the final parsed output.
- [ ] Test scenarios:
    - Successful code generation and execution.
    - Handling of code execution errors (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors).
    - Max iteration limits.
    - Multi-field output parsing.
- [ ] For effectful operations, test success and failure paths using Effect patterns.

## Verification Steps
- All converted `ProgramOfThought` module tests should initially fail.
- Test logic should be clear and target intended `ProgramOfThought` behavior.
- Type errors in test code should be resolved.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific assertion styles, mock data generation.
- User Input: Clarification on Python test behavior or interpreter interaction if ambiguous.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- The design of the code execution environment for DSTyS (e.g., if a Deno-like JS interpreter is used or if it's heavily mocked).
- How `ProgramOfThought` handles the iterative generation and execution loop with Effect.

### Non-blocking
- Specific error types for code execution failures.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial tests might heavily mock the interpreter, focusing on the LM interaction and parsing logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This is the core test conversion for the `ProgramOfThought` module. Testing code execution requires careful mocking or sandboxing.
