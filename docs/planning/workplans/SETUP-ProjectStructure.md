# SETUP-ProjectStructure

## Task ID
SETUP-ProjectStructure

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS project requires a well-structured foundation to ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of development. We need to set up the initial project structure, build system, and CI/CD pipeline to enable efficient development and ensure code quality throughout the project lifecycle.

## Proposed Implementation
We will set up a modern TypeScript project structure using ESM modules, with a comprehensive build system and CI/CD pipeline. The implementation will include:

1. Project directory structure following best practices for TypeScript libraries
2. TypeScript configuration optimized for the project requirements
3. ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality and consistency
4. Vitest setup for unit and integration testing
5. GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
6. Documentation generation setup using TypeDoc
7. Package.json configuration for dependencies and scripts

The project will use a monorepo structure to organize the codebase into logical modules while maintaining a single repository. This will allow for better code organization and separation of concerns.

Testing will be implemented using Vitest, with a focus on unit tests for individual components and integration tests for component interactions. The CI/CD pipeline will run tests, linting, and type checking on every pull request to ensure code quality.

## Components Involved
- Project structure and organization
- Build system and tooling
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation generation

## Dependencies
- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- ESM module system
- Effect library
- Zod library
- Vitest testing framework
- ESLint and Prettier
- GitHub Actions

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create basic directory structure
  - [ ] src/ for source code
  - [ ] test/ for tests
  - [ ] docs/ for documentation
  - [ ] scripts/ for build and utility scripts
- [ ] Configure TypeScript
  - [ ] Create tsconfig.json with appropriate settings
  - [ ] Configure module resolution
  - [ ] Set up type declarations
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier
  - [ ] Create .eslintrc.js with rules
  - [ ] Create .prettierrc with formatting rules
  - [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Configure testing with Vitest
  - [ ] Create vitest.config.ts
  - [ ] Set up test utilities
  - [ ] Configure code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
  - [ ] Create CI workflow for pull requests
  - [ ] Configure test and lint jobs
  - [ ] Set up dependency caching
- [ ] Configure package.json
  - [ ] Add dependencies
  - [ ] Configure scripts for build, test, lint
  - [ ] Set up package metadata
- [ ] Set up documentation generation
  - [ ] Configure TypeDoc
  - [ ] Create documentation templates
- [ ] Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Set up example files to demonstrate project structure

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm install` to verify dependency installation works correctly
2. Run `npm run build` to verify the build process works
3. Run `npm run test` to verify the testing setup works
4. Run `npm run lint` to verify linting works
5. Push a test commit to verify GitHub Actions workflow runs correctly
6. Run `npm run docs` to verify documentation generation works
7. Verify that the project structure follows the defined organization

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Directory structure details
  - Specific ESLint and Prettier rules
  - Test organization
  - GitHub Actions workflow details
  - Documentation structure

- Requires user input:
  - Major architectural decisions
  - Technology stack changes
  - CI/CD deployment targets
  - Package naming and versioning strategy

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- Should we use npm, yarn, or pnpm as the package manager?
- Should we publish the package to npm or use a private registry?
- What should be the minimum supported Node.js version?

### Non-blocking
- Specific ESLint rules can be adjusted later based on team preferences
- Documentation generation format can be refined over time
- Test coverage thresholds can be adjusted based on project progress

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may start with a simpler CI/CD pipeline and enhance it over time
- Initial documentation may be minimal, focusing on API reference rather than comprehensive guides
- We may defer setting up complex monorepo tooling until needed
- Performance optimizations for the build process can be implemented later

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The project structure should be designed to accommodate future growth
- We should prioritize developer experience and ease of contribution
- The build system should be optimized for both development and production use cases
- We should consider using SWC for faster TypeScript compilation
