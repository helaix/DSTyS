# Workplan: Analyze Reliability Generated Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-RelGen-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of the generated test cases (program, inputs, assertions) and the patterns in the Python execution script (`test_generated.py`).

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the structure of `GeneratedTestCase` dataclass.
- Examine example generated files (program.py, schema.json, inputX.json) from `dspy/tests/reliability/complex_types/generated/` or `input_formats/generated/`.
- Document how `run_generated_case` in Python:
    - Loads the generated program.
    - Validates/parses JSON input against the program's input schema.
    - Executes the program.
    - Uses a judge LM with `assert_program_output_correct` to validate output against assertions.
- Identify challenges for replicating this in TypeScript.

## Components Involved
- Python `GeneratedTestCase` structure.
- Example generated test files.
- Python `run_generated_case` logic.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RelGen-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Document the fields of `GeneratedTestCase`.
- [ ] Analyze the format of `program.py` (how it defines inputs/outputs using Pydantic and DSPy Signatures).
- [ ] Analyze the format of `schema.json` (JSON schema of the program).
- [ ] Analyze the format of `inputX.json` (JSON input and natural language assertions).
- [ ] Detail the steps in Python's `run_generated_case` and `assert_program_output_correct`.
- [ ] List key challenges for a TypeScript version (e.g., dynamic program loading, Pydantic to Zod, judge LM interaction).

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately describes the structure and execution flow of generated reliability tests.
- Conversion challenges are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How to dynamically load and execute TypeScript "programs" if generation is ported.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on the execution and validation part first, assuming test cases might be pre-generated.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This detailed structural analysis is crucial for designing the DSTyS equivalent.
