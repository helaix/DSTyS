## 4. API Design

### 4.1 API Overview
The DSTyS API is designed to be intuitive for TypeScript developers while maintaining feature parity with Python DSPy. It leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time safety and Effect for functional programming patterns and error handling.

### 4.2 Core API Components

#### 4.2.1 Signatures
Signatures define the input and output types for modules.

```typescript
// Example Signature Definition
const QuestionAnswerSignature = Signature({
  question: Field(String, "The question to answer"),
  answer: Field(String, "The answer to the question")
});
```

#### 4.2.2 Modules
Modules are the building blocks of DSTyS pipelines.

```typescript
// Example Module Definition
class QuestionAnswerer extends Module({
  input: QuestionSignature,
  output: AnswerSignature
}) {
  constructor(private lm: LanguageModel) {
    super();
  }

  forward = (input: Input<typeof QuestionSignature>) => {
    return this.lm.predict(
      QuestionAnswerSignature,
      { question: input.question }
    );
  };
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Predictors
Predictors are specialized modules that implement different prediction patterns.

```typescript
// Example Chain of Thought Predictor
const answerer = new ChainOfThought({
  signature: QuestionAnswerSignature,
  lm: new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-4" })
});
```

### 4.3 Error Handling
DSTyS uses Effect for comprehensive error handling.

```typescript
// Example Error Handling
const result = await pipe(
  answerer.predict({ question: "What is the capital of France?" }),
  Effect.catchTag("RateLimitError", (error) => 
    Effect.delay(Effect.retry(error), 1000)
  ),
  Effect.catchTag("ModelError", (error) => 
    Effect.fail(new Error(`Model error: ${error.message}`))
  ),
  Effect.runPromise
);
```

### 4.4 API Documentation
The API will be documented using TypeDoc with the following components:
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Tutorials and guides

### 4.5 API Versioning Strategy
DSTyS will follow semantic versioning:
- **Major versions**: Breaking changes
- **Minor versions**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **Patch versions**: Bug fixes, non-breaking changes

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 Data Model Overview
The DSTyS data model is designed to represent the core concepts of the DSPy framework in TypeScript. It leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time safety and validation.

### 5.2 Core Data Entities

#### 5.2.1 Signature
Represents the input and output types for modules.

```typescript
interface SignatureDefinition {
  fields: Record<string, FieldDefinition>;
  description?: string;
}

interface FieldDefinition {
  type: Type<any>;
  description: string;
  required: boolean;
  default?: any;
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Module
Represents a composable unit of functionality.

```typescript
interface ModuleDefinition {
  input: SignatureDefinition;
  output: SignatureDefinition;
}

interface Module<I, O> {
  forward: (input: I) => Effect<O, Error, never>;
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Prediction

  tokens: number;
  latency: number;
}
```

#### 5.2.4 Language Model
Represents a foundation model.

```typescript
interface LanguageModel {
  predict: <T>(signature: SignatureDefinition, input: Record<string, any>) => Effect<Prediction<T>, Error, never>;
}
```

### 5.3 Entity Relationship Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    MODULE ||--o{ SIGNATURE : "has input/output"
    MODULE ||--o{ PREDICTION : "produces"
    LANGUAGE_MODEL ||--o{ PREDICTION : "generates"
    SIGNATURE ||--o{ FIELD : "contains"
    PREDICTION ||--o{ TRACE : "has"
    
    MODULE {

    }
    
    LANGUAGE_MODEL {
        string id
        string provider
        string model
    }
```

### 5.4 Data Storage
As a library, DSTyS itself doesn't store data persistently, but it provides interfaces for caching predictions:

```typescript
interface Cache {
  get: (key: string) => Effect<Prediction<any> | null, Error, never>;
  set: (key: string, value: Prediction<any>) => Effect<void, Error, never>;
}
```

Implementations will be provided for:

### 7.2 Test Levels

#### 7.2.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Use property-based testing for complex logic

```typescript
// Example Unit Test
test("Signature validates input correctly", () => {
  const signature = Signature({
    name: Field(String, "Person's name"),
    age: Field(Number, "Person's age")
  });
  
  // Valid input
  expect(signature.validate({ name: "John", age: 30 })).toEqual({ name: "John", age: 30 });
  
  // Invalid input
  expect(() => signature.validate({ name: "John", age: "30" })).toThrow();
});
```

#### 7.2.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Test integration with external services using mocks
- Focus on component interfaces

```typescript
// Example Integration Test
test("Module uses language model correctly", async () => {
  const mockLM = {
    predict: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ output: { answer: "Paris" } })
  };
  
  const module = new QuestionAnswerer(mockLM);
  const result = await module.forward({ question: "What is the capital of France?" });
  
  expect(result).toEqual({ answer: "Paris" });
  expect(mockLM.predict).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.anything(),
    { question: "What is the capital of France?" }
  );
});
```

#### 7.2.3 System Testing
- Test complete pipelines
- Test with real external services in controlled environments
- Focus on end-to-end behavior

```typescript
// Example System Test
test("Complete pipeline works end-to-end", async () => {
  // Set up a complete pipeline
  const lm = new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
  const retriever = new VectorRetriever(/* ... */);
  const answerer = new RAG({ lm, retriever });
  
  // Test with a real question
  const result = await answerer.forward({ question: "What is TypeScript?" });
  
  // Verify the result meets expectations
  expect(result.answer).toContain("programming language");
});
```

#### 7.2.4 Performance Testing
- Benchmark key operations
- Compare performance with direct API calls
- Identify and address bottlenecks

```typescript
// Example Performance Test
benchmark("Prediction performance", async () => {
  const lm = new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
  const module = new QuestionAnswerer(lm);
  
  // Warm-up
  await module.forward({ question: "Warm-up question?" });
  
  // Benchmark
  const start = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await module.forward({ question: `Question ${i}?` });
  }
  const end = performance.now();
  
  expect(end - start).toBeLessThan(10000); // Less than 1s per question on average
});
```
