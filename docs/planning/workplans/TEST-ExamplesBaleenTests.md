# Epic Overview: Baleen Example Tests Conversion (TEST-ExamplesBaleenTests)

## Task ID
TEST-ExamplesBaleenTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To ensure that complex, multi-hop question answering programs like the "Baleen" example can be built and tested with DSTyS, we need to analyze the Python DSPy tests for Baleen (from `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`) and determine their conversion strategy.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
The process involves analyzing Python tests for the Baleen example.
1.  Analyze Python `test_baleen.py` to understand how the `SimplifiedBaleen` module is constructed, how it interacts with LMs and RMs, and how its multi-hop logic is tested.
2.  Determine the scope of porting these tests: Are they unit tests for `SimplifiedBaleen` logic, or integration tests requiring specific LM/RM behavior?
3.  If porting:
    *   Re-implement conceptual test equivalents in TypeScript using Vitest.
    *   Adapt test logic for TypeScript's type system and Effect TS patterns for LM/RM calls.
    *   Create mock LMs, RMs, and data (e.g., HotPotQA samples) for testing.
The outcome will guide how complex example programs are tested in DSTyS.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Python test file: `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`
- DSTyS component: `SimplifiedBaleen.ts` (or equivalent example program).
- Vitest testing framework
- Mock LMs, RMs, and datasets.

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure
- SETUP-DependencyManagement
- TEST-Framework
- TEST-ConversionTemplate
- Core DSTyS primitives (`Module`, `Predict`, `Retrieve`, `ChainOfThought`).

- [TEST-ExBaleen-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-ExBaleen-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent: Design of mock LMs/RMs for Baleen.
- User Input: None anticipated unless major deviations from Baleen logic are needed.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)
### Blocking
- Availability of core DSTyS components needed by Baleen (multi-hop CoT, Retrieve).
### Non-blocking
- Complexity of mocking multi-hop interactions.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- Initial tests might use heavily simplified mock data and LM/RM responses.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Testing example programs like Baleen validates the composability and functionality of core DSTyS modules.
