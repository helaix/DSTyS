# Workplan: Document Reliability Generated Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-RelGen-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document the patterns and processes for using the generated reliability test harness in DSTyS.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the `Generated.test.ts` harness and related utilities.
- Document:
    - How to structure and load `GeneratedTestCase` data.
    - How DSTyS programs are expected to be defined for compatibility with the harness (e.g., regarding input/output schemas).
    - The role and expected behavior of the judge LM.
    - How `assertProgramOutputCorrectTS` works.
    - Process for adding new generated test cases or categories.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/reliability/Generated.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RelGen-06-VerifyCoverage`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review reliability test harness.
- [ ] Document the workflow for using generated tests.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- Documented patterns are clear and accurate.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.
