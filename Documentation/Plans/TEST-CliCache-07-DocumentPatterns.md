# Workplan: Document dspy.cache Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliCache-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `dspy.cache` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar caching mechanisms or decorated functions.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Cache.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mock functions to cache, managing temporary cache directories), common assertion patterns for cache hits/misses, or specific ways Effect TS was used if caching is effectful.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different caching scenarios (memory, disk, decorator) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/Cache.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliCache-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `dspy.cache` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Cache.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to test functions decorated with `@requestCache` (or TS equivalent).
    - How to test direct `cache.put()` and `cache.get()` operations.
    - How to set up and test in-memory and disk caching.
    - Testing of cache key generation logic (if applicable).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `dspy.cache` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `dspy.cache` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers to testing practices for caching.
