# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for Doc Links Tests (If Applicable)

## Task ID
TEST-DocsMkLnk-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
If documentation link validation tests are implemented, create mock documentation configuration files and dummy documentation files to test the link validation logic.

## Proposed Implementation
- **Conditional on implementing doc link validation tests.**
- Create mock documentation configuration files (e.g., a mock `mkdocs.yml` or `docusaurus.config.js` equivalent) with sample navigation structures.
    - Include links that point to existing mock files.
    - Include links that point to non-existent files.
- Create a small hierarchy of dummy Markdown files within `tests/docs/mock_docs_root/` to serve as targets for valid links.
- These mocks will be used by the doc link validation tests.

## Components Involved
- `tests/docs/mock_doc_config.yml` (or `.json`, `.js`).
- `tests/docs/mock_docs_root/` directory with dummy `.md` files.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-DocsMkLnk-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests will use these mocks).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] If doc link validation is in scope:
    - [ ] Create a mock doc config file with a sample navigation structure.
        - Include some valid and some invalid links.
    - [ ] Create a `tests/docs/mock_docs_root/` directory.
    - [ ] Populate it with a few dummy `.md` files corresponding to the valid links in the mock config.
    - [ ] Ensure tests in `DocLinks.test.ts` use this mock config and root.
- [ ] If not in scope, mark N/A.

## Verification Steps
- If applicable, mock config and doc files are correctly structured.
- Tests can successfully parse the mock config and check links against the mock doc files.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Content of mock files.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Format of the actual DSTyS documentation configuration.

### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Mock structure can be very simple.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Mocking the doc structure allows testing link validation without relying on the full, potentially large, actual documentation.
