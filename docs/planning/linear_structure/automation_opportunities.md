- Update workplan issue status accordingly
- Run on a schedule or trigger on sub-issue status change

**Benefits**:
- Provides accurate progress tracking
- Reduces manual status updates
- Ensures consistency in status reporting

### Status Visualization

**Automation Opportunity**: Generate status visualizations for workplans and epics.

**Implementation**:
- Create a script that generates status dashboards or reports
- Use Linear API to fetch status data
- Generate visualizations (e.g., progress charts, burndown charts)
- Update visualization on a schedule or on status changes

**Benefits**:
- Improves visibility into project status
- Facilitates communication with stakeholders
- Supports data-driven decision making

## 5. Notification System

Automated notifications can keep stakeholders informed of important changes.
