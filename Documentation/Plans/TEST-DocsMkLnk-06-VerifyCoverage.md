# Workplan: Verify Doc Links Test Coverage (If Applicable)

## Task ID
TEST-DocsMkLnk-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
If documentation link validation tests are implemented, verify that the test suite achieves adequate code coverage for the link validation logic.

## Proposed Implementation
- **Conditional on implementing doc link validation tests.**
- After the doc link validation logic is implemented and tests pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for the source file containing link validation logic.
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests if necessary.

## Components Involved
- Source file for doc link validation logic.
- `tests/docs/DocLinks.test.ts` (conditional).
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-DocsLinkValidationImpl` (Conceptual implementation task).
- All doc link tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] If doc link validation is in scope:
    - [ ] Ensure link validation logic is complete and tests pass.
    - [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
    - [ ] Examine coverage for the relevant source file.
    - [ ] If below target, add more tests.
- [ ] If not in scope, mark N/A.

## Verification Steps
- If applicable, coverage report shows good coverage for link validation logic.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Decision on implementing these tests.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Coverage might be focused on the core parsing and checking logic.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures the link checker itself is robust.
