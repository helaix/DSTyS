# Workplan: Document Prediction Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredTests-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document specific patterns, utilities, or approaches used in testing the `Prediction` and `Completions` classes.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review `Prediction.test.ts`.
- Identify patterns for:
    - Testing instantiation from completion data.
    - Asserting properties of `Prediction` and `Completions`.
    - Testing LM usage tracking.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/primitives/Prediction.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredTests-06-VerifyCoverage` (`Prediction` tests finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Prediction.test.ts`.
- [ ] Document:
    - Testing `Prediction.fromCompletions`.
    - Testing access to `completions` and their fields.
    - Testing LM usage methods.
    - Helper functions for mock completion data.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- Documented patterns are clear and accurate.
- Examples are correct.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Concise documentation.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Aids consistency in testing components that consume `Prediction` objects.
