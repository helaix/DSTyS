# Workplan: Verify Field Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-FldTests-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the `Field` component is implemented and its tests are passing, verify that the test suite achieves the desired code coverage for `Field.ts`.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `CORE-FieldImpl` tasks are complete and all tests in `TEST-FldTests` are passing:
    - Run the test suite with coverage reporting enabled (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Analyze the coverage report specifically for `source/signatures/Field.ts`.
    - Identify any untested lines, branches, or functions.
    - Write additional tests to cover these gaps, if critical.
    - Aim for >90% coverage for `Field.ts` as it's a core primitive.
- Testing: This task is about analyzing and improving test coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Field.ts` (the implementation).
- `tests/signatures/Field.test.ts` (the tests).
- Vitest coverage reporting tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-FieldImpl-07-TestCompatibility` (All `Field` tests passing against the implementation).
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Field.ts` implementation is complete and all existing tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine the coverage report for `source/signatures/Field.ts`.
- [ ] If coverage is below target (e.g., 90%):
    - [ ] Identify specific lines/branches not covered.
    - [ ] Write new test cases in `Field.test.ts` to cover these gaps.
    - [ ] Re-run coverage until target is met or remaining gaps are justified as non-critical.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows target coverage (e.g., >90%) for `Field.ts`.
- All critical paths and functionalities of `Field` are covered by tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Writing additional tests.
- User Input: Acceptance of any coverage gaps if 100% is not feasible/practical.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None, assuming implementation and basic tests are done.

### Non-blocking
- Deciding if certain minor branches (e.g., defensive error handling for theoretically impossible states) absolutely need coverage.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May accept slightly below 100% coverage if the remaining uncovered code is trivial or extremely defensive.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
High test coverage for core primitives like `Field` is essential for library stability.
