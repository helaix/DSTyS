# Workplan: Create Common Test Utilities

## Task ID
TEST-Frmwk-05-CreateTestUtils

## Problem Statement
Develop a set of common test utilities and helper functions to reduce boilerplate, improve test readability, and ensure consistency across the test suite.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create a dedicated directory for test utilities (e.g., `tests/utils/`).
- Identify common setup, teardown, or assertion patterns that emerge during early test development.
- Implement reusable helper functions for these patterns. Examples might include:
    - Creating mock LM instances with predefined responses.
    - Setting up standard `Signature` or `Field` configurations for tests.
    - Helper for asserting specific Effect error tags and payloads.
    - Fixture loading utilities if test data is stored in files.
- Ensure utilities are well-documented and easy to use.
- Refactor existing tests (if any) to use these utilities.

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/` directory and files within (e.g., `mockLm.ts`, `testSetup.ts`).
- Test files that will consume these utilities.

## Dependencies
- Initial test development (e.g., for `Field`, `Signature`) will reveal needs for utilities.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `tests/utils/` directory.
- [ ] As common patterns are identified in `TEST-FldTests`, `TEST-SigTests`, etc.:
    - [ ] Implement helper for creating mock `LM` instances (e.g., `createMockLm(responses: Record<string, string>)`).
    - [ ] Implement helper for creating standard test `Signature` objects.
    - [ ] Consolidate Effect assertion helpers (from `TEST-Frmwk-02-EffectIntegration`) here if they become generic.
- [ ] Ensure all utilities are typed and have JSDoc comments.
- [ ] Write tests for complex utilities themselves, if applicable.
- [ ] Document the availability and usage of these utilities for developers.

## Verification Steps
- Test utilities are functional and correctly used in example tests.
- Usage of utilities reduces boilerplate in test files.
- Documentation for utilities is clear.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific implementation of utilities.
- User Input: None, as needs will emerge from test development.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- The set of utilities will evolve as more components are tested.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Start with a small set of essential utilities and expand as needed. Avoid creating utilities prematurely.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good test utilities can significantly improve the efficiency of writing and maintaining tests.
