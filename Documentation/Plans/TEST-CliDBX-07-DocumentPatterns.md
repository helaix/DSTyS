# Workplan: Document Databricks Client Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliDBX-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the Databricks Client component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar LM provider integrations, especially those involving SDKs or complex API interactions.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `DatabricksClient.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking Databricks SDK calls, simulating API responses), common assertion patterns for job statuses or deployment outcomes, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing asynchronous API calls.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different Databricks client operations (finetuning, deployment, basic LM calls) were tested with mocks.

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/DatabricksClient.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliDBX-06-VerifyCoverage` (All Databricks Client tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `DatabricksClient.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to mock Databricks SDK calls effectively using `vi.mock`.
    - Patterns for simulating different Databricks API responses (success, failure, pending states).
    - Testing of finetuning job lifecycle (creation, status check, completion).
    - Testing of model deployment and endpoint status checks.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for Databricks Client tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to Databricks Client testing and SDK mocking.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns for provider-specific clients improves maintainability and helps in adding support for new providers.
