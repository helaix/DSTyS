# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for Prediction Tests

## Task ID
TEST-PredTests-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Develop mock data and utilities for `Prediction` tests, primarily focusing on creating representative completion objects.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create helper functions to generate mock completion data (e.g., arrays of objects with `answer`, `rationale` fields).
- If `Prediction` interacts deeply with `Signature` for field validation during access, mock `Signature` instances might be needed.
- Ensure mocks are simple and focused on `Prediction`'s direct needs.

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/mocks/mockCompletions.ts` (or similar).
- `tests/primitives/Prediction.test.ts`.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredTests-04-AdaptTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `generateMockCompletions(count: number, fields: string[])` helper.
- [ ] If `Prediction` methods use `Signature` for validation, create a `mockBasicSignature` helper.
- [ ] Integrate these into `Prediction.test.ts`.

## Verification Steps
- Mocks simplify test setup for `Prediction` tests.
- Mocks accurately represent the data structures `Prediction` expects.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on mocking data structures rather than complex behavior for `Prediction` tests.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good mock data is key for testing `Prediction`'s handling of completions.
