# Context7 Documentation Tools

These tools allow fetching up-to-date documentation for various libraries directly within the chat.

## Process

Fetching documentation is a two-step process:

1.  **Resolve Library ID (`mcp_context7_resolve-library-id`)**: 
    -   Provide the general name of the library (e.g., `react`, `@tanstack/react-router`) using the `libraryName` parameter.
    -   This tool returns a list of matching libraries and their specific `Context7-compatible library ID` (e.g., `/facebook/react`, `/tanstack/router`). You need this exact ID for the next step.

2.  **Get Library Docs (`mcp_context7_get-library-docs`)**:
    -   Provide the exact `context7CompatibleLibraryID` obtained from the previous step.
    -   (Optional) Specify a `topic` to focus the documentation search (e.g., `hooks`, `file-based routing`).
    -   (Optional) Adjust the maximum `tokens` (default 5000) to control the amount of documentation returned.
    -   This tool retrieves relevant documentation snippets based on the ID and optional topic.

## Example Usage

To get documentation about TanStack Router's file-based routing:
1. Call `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` with `libraryName: "@tanstack/react-router"`.
2. Identify the correct ID (e.g., `/tanstack/router`).
3. Call `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/tanstack/router"` and `topic: "file-based routing"`.
