# Workplan: Field Type Definition

## Task ID
CORE-FieldImpl-01-TypeDef

## Problem Statement
Define the core `Field` type in TypeScript. This type will represent the schema and metadata for individual input and output fields within a DSPy `Signature`. It needs to support generics for type safety and include provisions for metadata like descriptions and prefixes.

## Proposed Implementation
- Define a `Field` class or interface, likely generic (e.g., `Field<T>`).
- Incorporate properties for essential metadata:
    - `description: string` (for documentation and potentially for prompts)
    - `prefix: string` (for formatting in prompts)
    - `type: ZodType<T>` (or similar, to hold the Zod schema for runtime validation)
    - `required: boolean` (optional, default to true)
- Create a factory function (e.g., `createField<T>(...)`) or a well-defined constructor for instantiating `Field` objects in a type-safe way.
- Ensure the definition allows for easy extension or differentiation between InputFields and OutputFields, possibly through a discriminator property or separate derived types.
- Testing: Unit tests will verify correct instantiation, metadata storage, and type handling with generics.

## Components Involved
- `source/signatures/Field.ts` (new or to be modified)
- TypeScript type definitions
- Zod library (for the `type` property)

## Dependencies
- `SETUP-ProjStruct-02-TSConfig` (TypeScript configuration)
- Zod library installed (`SETUP-DepMgmt-02-DependenciesSetup`)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define the main `Field<T>` interface or class structure.
- [ ] Add properties for `description`, `prefix`, `type` (Zod schema), and `required`.
- [ ] Implement a factory function `createField<T>(...)` or constructor.
- [ ] Ensure generic type `T` is correctly used and inferred.
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs and properties.
- [ ] Write unit tests for:
    - Field instantiation with various types (string, number, boolean, custom objects via Zod).
    - Correct storage and retrieval of metadata (description, prefix).
    - Handling of the `required` flag.

## Verification Steps
- Run unit tests for `Field.ts`.
- Ensure all tests related to basic Field definition, instantiation, and metadata pass.
- Code review for type safety, clarity, and adherence to TypeScript best practices.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Exact internal representation of metadata, naming of generic type parameters.
- User Input: If the core set of metadata (description, prefix) needs to be expanded significantly beyond Python DSPy's `Field` concept.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated for the basic definition.

### Non-blocking
- How to best integrate more complex Zod schemas (e.g., objects, arrays, unions) into the `type` property.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- The initial `type` property might only support basic Zod types, with more complex schema support refined during Zod integration.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task lays the groundwork for how Signatures will define their structure. The focus is on a type-safe and descriptive Field definition.
