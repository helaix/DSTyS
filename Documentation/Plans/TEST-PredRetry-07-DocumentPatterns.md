# Workplan: Document Retry Logic Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredRetry-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document specific patterns or utilities used in testing retry logic, especially for Effect TS `Schedule` and mock failing operations.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review retry logic test files.
- Document:
    - How to use mock operations that simulate sequences of failures/successes.
    - Patterns for testing `Effect.retry` with different `Schedule` configurations.
    - Asserting call counts and final outcomes.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or testing guide.

## Components Involved
- Retry logic test files.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredRetry-06-VerifyCoverage`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review retry logic tests.
- [ ] Document patterns for testing retries.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
