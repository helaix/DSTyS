# Workplan: Verify GRPO Optimizer Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-TpGRPO-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `GRPO.ts` is implemented and tests pass, verify test suite coverage for this optimizer.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `GRPO` implementation and tests pass:
    - Run `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for `source/teleprompt/GRPO.ts`.
    - Add tests for uncovered parts, aiming for >85% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/teleprompt/GRPO.ts`.
- `tests/teleprompt/GRPO.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-TelepromptGRPOImplementation` (Conceptual).
- All `GRPO` tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `GRPO.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage.
- [ ] If below target, add tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows >85% for `GRPO.ts`.
- Critical paths are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex RL logic.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Ensures `GRPO` is robust.
