# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for ProgramOfThought Module Tests

## Task ID
TEST-PredPoT-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Identify and create necessary mock implementations or test utilities for `ProgramOfThought` module tests. This includes mock LMs for code generation, a mock code interpreter, and mock `Signature` objects.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the converted `ProgramOfThought` module tests from `TEST-PredPoT-04-AdaptTests`.
- Create helper functions or mock classes for:
    - **Mock LM**: A `DummyLM` or mock that returns predefined code snippets (as strings) when prompted for code generation.
    - **Mock Code Interpreter**: A function or class that simulates the execution of code. It should:
        - Accept a code string.
        - Return a predefined result (e.g., a dictionary of output fields) or simulate an error (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `RuntimeError`).
        - This mock will be crucial if a full sandboxed JS interpreter is not used in unit tests.
    - **Mock Signature**: Simple `Signature` objects to define the I/O for `ProgramOfThought`.
- Place mocks in `tests/utils/mocks/` or alongside `ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.

## Components Involved
- `tests/predict/ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.
- `tests/utils/mocks/` (for shared mocks).
- Mock implementations for `LM`, code interpreter, `Signature`.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredPoT-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests will drive the need for specific mock behaviors).
- Core DSTyS `Signature`, `LM` class structures.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `MockLMForPoT` (or enhance `DummyLM`):
    - Configurable to return specific code strings for "generated_code" field.
- [ ] Create `mockCodeInterpreter(executionLogic: (code: string) => any | Error)`:
    - Takes a function that defines how to "execute" the code string.
    - This function can return a result or throw an error to simulate execution outcomes.
- [ ] Create helper `createMockPoTSignature(inputs: string[], outputs: string[])`.
- [ ] Integrate these mocks into `ProgramOfThought.test.ts`.

## Verification Steps
- Mocks and test utilities simplify `ProgramOfThought` module test code.
- Tests using mocks correctly isolate the `ProgramOfThought` logic from actual LM calls and code execution.
- Mocks accurately simulate the behavior of LMs and the code interpreter.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details of mocks.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- The interface of the code interpreter that `ProgramOfThought` will use.

### Non-blocking
- Mocks can be refined as the actual `ProgramOfThought` module and its interpreter are implemented.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- The mock interpreter can be very simple initially, just returning predefined outputs for specific code inputs.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Well-designed mocks are essential for testing the complex iterative logic of `ProgramOfThought`.
