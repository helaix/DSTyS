# Linear Structure for Workplan Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the recommended Linear structure to model workplans in the DSTy project. The structure is designed to ensure synchronization between documentation files and Linear issues, providing a consistent, scalable system for project management.

## Documents

- [**Workplan Linear Structure**](./workplan_linear_structure.md): The main document outlining the recommended Linear structure for workplans, including hierarchy design, field mapping, relationship modeling, and synchronization strategy.

- [**Workplan Template Mapping**](./workplan_template_mapping.md): A detailed mapping between workplan template sections and Linear issue fields, ensuring consistency between documentation and issue tracking.

- [**Implementation Guidelines**](./implementation_guidelines.md): Practical guidelines for implementing the Linear structure for workplans, including step-by-step instructions for creating epics, workplans, and tasks.

- [**Sample Implementation**](./sample_implementation.md): A concrete example of how to implement the Linear structure using an existing workplan from the DSTy project.

- [**Automation Opportunities**](./automation_opportunities.md): Potential automation opportunities to maintain synchronization between workplan documentation files and Linear issues, improving efficiency and consistency.

## Quick Start

To get started with the Linear structure for workplans:

1. Read the [Workplan Linear Structure](./workplan_linear_structure.md) document to understand the overall design.
2. Review the [Workplan Template Mapping](./workplan_template_mapping.md) to see how workplan sections map to Linear fields.
3. Follow the [Implementation Guidelines](./implementation_guidelines.md) to create your first workplan in Linear.
4. Use the [Sample Implementation](./sample_implementation.md) as a reference for creating your own workplans.
5. Consider implementing some of the [Automation Opportunities](./automation_opportunities.md) to improve efficiency.

## Key Concepts

### Hierarchy Design

The recommended hierarchy for representing workplans in Linear follows a four-level structure:

```
Project (DSTyS)
└── Epic (Master Issue)
    └── Workplan (Implementation Chunk)
        └── Task (Specific Implementation Step)
```

### Field Mapping

Workplan template sections are mapped to Linear issue fields to ensure consistency between documentation and issue tracking. Custom fields are recommended to capture additional metadata.

### Synchronization Strategy

To maintain synchronization between documentation files and Linear issues, follow the update procedures outlined in the [Workplan Linear Structure](./workplan_linear_structure.md) document and consider implementing some of the automation opportunities.

### Implementation Guidelines

The [Implementation Guidelines](./implementation_guidelines.md) document provides practical guidance for creating epics, workplans, and tasks in Linear, including naming conventions, labeling, and status workflow.

## Contributing

To contribute to the Linear structure documentation:

1. Create a branch from the main branch.
2. Make your changes to the documentation.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
4. Ensure your changes are consistent with the existing documentation.
