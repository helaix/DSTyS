# Epic Overview: Signature Tests Conversion (TEST-SignatureTests)

## Task ID
TEST-SignatureTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the Signature class to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. These tests will serve as the specification for the Signature implementation and ensure feature parity with the Python version while leveraging TypeScript's type system and Effect's functional programming patterns.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will convert the Python tests for the Signature class to TypeScript, adapting them to work with the TypeScript type system and Effect TS patterns. The process involves:
1. Analyzing Python Signature tests (string-based, class-based, field management, validation).
2. Re-implementing these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3. Adapting test logic for TypeScript's static typing, Effect TS patterns (for validation), and Zod schema integration.
4. Creating necessary mocks (e.g., for `Field` instances).
The converted tests will guide the `CORE-SignatureImplementation`.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Vitest testing framework
- TypeScript test files for `Signature`
- Mocks for `Field`
- Effect TS and Zod testing patterns

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (Vitest setup, Effect test utilities)
- TEST-ConversionTemplate (guidelines for test conversion)
- TEST-FieldTests & CORE-FieldImplementation (must be completed first)

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-SigTests-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Signature tests
- [TEST-SigTests-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure and patterns
- [TEST-SigTests-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TypeScript test files
- [TEST-SigTests-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TypeScript & Effect
- [TEST-SigTests-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mock implementations
- [TEST-SigTests-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify test coverage
- [TEST-SigTests-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-SigTests-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document test patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Test file organization and naming.
  - Test utility implementation details.
  - Mock implementation details.
  - TypeScript-specific test adaptations.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python test coverage.
  - Additional test cases not present in Python version.
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Signature.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's class-based Signature definition in TypeScript?
- How should we integrate Effect TS patterns for error handling in tests for signature parsing/validation?
- How should we handle Python's metaclass functionality in TypeScript?

### Non-blocking
- Exact test organization can be refined over time.
- Test utility implementation details can be adjusted based on experience.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- We may need to adapt some Python test patterns to work better with TypeScript.
- Initial test coverage may not be 100% identical to Python version.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The Signature class is fundamental for module contracts; its tests are critical.
- Test conversion should focus on maintaining functional equivalence.
- These tests will build on patterns from `TEST-FieldTests`.
