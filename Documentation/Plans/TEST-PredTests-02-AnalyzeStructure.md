# Workplan: Analyze Prediction Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-PredTests-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns in Python tests for `dspy.Prediction`, focusing on how completions, LM usage, and other `Prediction`-specific attributes are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python `Prediction` test.
- Document patterns for:
    - Creating `Prediction` instances (e.g., `Prediction.from_completions`).
    - Testing access to completions and their fields.
    - Asserting LM usage data.
    - Testing any manipulation utilities specific to `Prediction`.
- Identify Python-specific features and challenges for TypeScript.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `Prediction` test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PredTests-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python `Prediction` test:
    - Document core assertions.
    - Note how `Prediction` instances are created and populated.
    - Identify Python-specific features used.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `Prediction` features.
- [ ] List helper functions/fixtures used.
- [ ] Identify challenges for TypeScript/Effect conversion.

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately reflects Python `Prediction` test patterns.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How Python's dynamic attribute access for completion fields is tested.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `Prediction`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis guides the TypeScript test implementation for `Prediction`.
