# Workplan: Document Embeddings Retriever Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-RetEmb-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `Embeddings` retriever component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar in-memory retrieval mechanisms.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `EmbeddingsRetriever.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock corpus, mock embedders), common assertion patterns for retrieved documents and indices, or specific ways concurrency was tested.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different search scenarios were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/retrievers/EmbeddingsRetriever.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RetEmb-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `EmbeddingsRetriever` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `EmbeddingsRetriever.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock corpus and embedder functions.
    - Patterns for asserting retrieved passages and their indices.
    - Testing `k` parameter and other configuration options.
    - How multi-threaded or concurrent searches are tested (if applicable).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `EmbeddingsRetriever` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `EmbeddingsRetriever` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps in testing other retrieval components.
