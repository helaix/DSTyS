# Workplan: Analyze Metadata Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-Meta-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for package metadata. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for metadata from `TEST-Meta-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking specific string values, regex matching for version).
- Identify how metadata is accessed in Python tests (e.g., `dspy.__version__`).
- Note any dependencies on how the Python package is built or how `__metadata__.py` is structured.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python metadata test cases from `dspy/tests/metadata/test_metadata.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Meta-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for metadata).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python metadata test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made for each metadata field.
    - [ ] Note how the metadata values are obtained for testing.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for metadata attributes.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript (e.g., how to access `package.json` values or values from a `metadata.ts` file in tests).

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python metadata tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- How version numbers are formatted and validated.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to asserting metadata values.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files for metadata.
