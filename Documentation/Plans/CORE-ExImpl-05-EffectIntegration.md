# Workplan: Example Effect Integration

## Task ID
CORE-ExImpl-05-EffectIntegration

## Problem Statement
Integrate the Effect library for error handling within the `Example` class, particularly for operations that might fail, such as validation against a signature or potentially complex field transformations.

## Proposed Implementation
- Identify methods within the `Example` class (or related utilities) that can fail (e.g., `validate(signature)`).
- Refactor these methods to return `Effect.Effect<SuccessType, ErrorType>` instead of throwing exceptions directly.
- Define custom error types (e.g., `ExampleValidationError`, `FieldTypeError`) using `Data.TaggedError` for structured error information.
- Ensure that Effect-based error handling is used consistently for operations involving `Example` objects where failure is a possibility.
- Testing: Write unit tests to verify that Effect-based error handling works correctly. Test scenarios where operations succeed and where they fail, ensuring the correct `Effect` (Success or Failure with appropriate error tag) is returned.

## Components Involved
- `source/primitives/Example.ts`
- Effect library (`Effect`, `Data.TaggedError`)

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ExImpl-01-ClassDef` (Example class definition)
- `CORE-ExImpl-04-SignatureIntegration` (if validation is the primary use case for Effect here)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Identify methods in `Example` or related utilities suitable for Effect-based error handling (e.g., validation).
- [ ] Define custom error types (e.g., `ExampleValidationError` extending `Data.TaggedError`).
- [ ] Refactor identified methods to return `Effect.Effect`.
- [ ] Use `Effect.succeed` for successful outcomes and `Effect.fail` with custom errors for failures.
- [ ] Write unit tests to cover both success and failure paths for Effect-ful methods.
    - Test that successful operations yield the correct value within `Effect.Success`.
    - Test that failing operations yield `Effect.Failure` with the correct error tag and payload.

## Verification Steps
- Run unit tests focusing on Effect integration in `Example.ts`.
- Ensure that methods correctly return `Effect.Success` or `Effect.Failure` as appropriate.
- Verify that error objects contain useful information for debugging.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific structure of custom error types.
- User Input: Which specific `Example` methods should be made Effect-ful beyond validation.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated if focused on validation.

### Non-blocking
- Deciding the granularity of error types (one generic `ExampleError` vs. more specific errors).

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Initial integration might focus solely on the `validate` method, with other methods considered for Effect integration later.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Using Effect for error handling will make `Example` operations more robust and composable within the broader Effect-based DSTyS ecosystem.
