# Workplan: Document TwoStep Adapter Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-AdTwoStp-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `TwoStepAdapter` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar multi-stage adapter components.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `TwoStepAdapter.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking main and extraction LMs, setting up complex Signatures), common assertion patterns for the two-stage process, or specific ways Effect TS was used.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how `TwoStepAdapter`'s interactions with both LMs and its parsing logic were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/adapters/TwoStepAdapter.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-AdTwoStp-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `TwoStepAdapter` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `TwoStepAdapter.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to mock and test the main generation LM call.
    - How to mock and test the extraction LM call.
    - How the internal extraction signature creation is tested (if applicable).
    - Testing the overall flow and final parsed output.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `TwoStepAdapter` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `TwoStepAdapter` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers to testing practices for multi-stage adapters.
