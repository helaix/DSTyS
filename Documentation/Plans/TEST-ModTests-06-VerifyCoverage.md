# Workplan: Verify Module Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-ModTests-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once `Module.ts` is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves the target code coverage for the `Module` base class functionalities.

## Proposed Implementation
- After `CORE-ModuleImplementation` is complete and `TEST-ModTests` pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage report for `source/primitives/Module.ts`.
    - Identify untested parts of `Module` base class logic.
    - Write additional tests to cover gaps, aiming for >90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/primitives/Module.ts`.
- `tests/primitives/Module.test.ts`.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-ModImpl-07-TestCompatibility` (All `Module` tests passing).
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Module.ts` implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for `source/primitives/Module.ts`.
- [ ] If below target (e.g., 90%):
    - Identify uncovered lines/branches.
    - Add new tests in `Module.test.ts`.
    - Re-run coverage until target is met or gaps are justified.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows >90% for `Module.ts`.
- All critical paths in `Module` base class are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps if 100% is impractical.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of highly dynamic parts like `named_parameters` might be tricky.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial or defensive.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
High coverage for `Module` is vital as it's a base for many components.
