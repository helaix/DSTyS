# Workplan: Analyze LiteLLM Cache Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CacheLite-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for LiteLLM caching. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how cache hits/misses, in-memory vs. disk caching, and cache key generation are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for LiteLLM caching from `TEST-CacheLite-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking number of LM calls, verifying cached responses, testing behavior with different cache configurations).
- Identify how Python's features (like `pytest` fixtures for temporary directories) are used and how these might translate to TypeScript/Vitest.
- Note any dependencies on other DSPy components (like `LM` client).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic, especially for managing cache state.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python LiteLLM caching test cases from `dspy/tests/caching/test_litellm_cache.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CacheLite-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for LiteLLM Caching).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python LiteLLM caching test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made.
    - [ ] Note how cache configurations and LM clients are set up.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific features or fixtures.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for LiteLLM caching features.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used in the Python tests.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python LiteLLM caching tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how to replicate Python's temporary file/directory fixtures in Vitest for disk cache tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to LiteLLM caching's core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and any necessary helper utilities for LiteLLM Caching.
