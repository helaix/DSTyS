# DSTy Project Template Examples

This directory contains example implementations of the DSTy project templates. These examples demonstrate how to apply the templates to real-world scenarios and can be used as references when creating new documents.

## Available Examples

### 1. [Workplan Example: Core Primitives](./workplan_example_core_primitives.md)

This example demonstrates how to apply the [Workplan Template](../templates/workplan_template.md) to a specific implementation chunk of the DSTyS project. It provides:

- Detailed task breakdown with effort estimates and dependencies
- Technical specifications with component diagrams and API definitions
- Comprehensive testing strategy with specific test cases
- Implementation guidance with code examples and best practices
- Clear review criteria for evaluating the implementation

#### Key Features Demonstrated

- **Task Breakdown**: How to break down a complex implementation into specific, actionable tasks
- **Task Sequencing**: How to define dependencies between tasks and create a logical sequence
- **Technical Specifications**: How to document component design, data models, and API specifications
- **Testing Strategy**: How to define a comprehensive testing approach with specific test cases
- **Implementation Guidance**: How to provide helpful guidance, code examples, and best practices
- **Review Criteria**: How to establish clear criteria for evaluating the implementation

#### When to Use This Example

Use this example as a reference when:
- Creating a workplan for implementing core components of a system
- Defining technical specifications for a complex implementation
- Establishing a testing strategy for a new feature
- Providing implementation guidance for developers
- Setting up review criteria for code quality

## Using These Examples

These examples are intended to be used as references when creating new documents using the DSTy project templates. They demonstrate how to apply the templates to real-world scenarios and provide guidance on the level of detail and structure expected in each document.

When using these examples:

1. **Understand the Context**: Read the example to understand the context and purpose of the document
2. **Identify Relevant Sections**: Focus on sections that are most relevant to your specific needs
3. **Adapt to Your Project**: Modify the content and structure to fit your project's requirements
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that your document follows the same level of detail and structure
