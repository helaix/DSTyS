# Workplan: Identify Python Signature Tests

## Task ID
TEST-SigTests-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
Locate and list all Python test files and specific test cases within the DSPy repository that are relevant to the functionality of the `dspy.Signature` class, including its interaction with `Field` objects.

## Proposed Implementation
- Examine `tests/signatures/test_signature.py` in Python DSPy.
- List all test functions/methods related to `Signature` (instantiation from string/class, field management, instruction handling, equality, manipulation methods like `with_instructions`, `with_updated_fields`).
- Note the purpose of each test.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (`tests/signatures/test_signature.py`).
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- Access to Python DSPy repository.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone/access Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Review `tests/signatures/test_signature.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions.
- [ ] Summarize the purpose of each test regarding `Signature` functionality.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases for `Signature`.

## Verification Steps
- The list of Python tests for `Signature` is comprehensive.
- The purpose of each test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Some tests might heavily involve `Field` setup.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on tests directly exercising `Signature` capabilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This inventory is crucial for porting `Signature` tests.
