# Workplan: Identify Python GroundedProposer Tests

## Task ID
TEST-PropGndP-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
To initiate the test conversion for the `GroundedProposer` optimizer, we must first comprehensively identify all relevant Python test cases from `dspy/tests/propose/test_grounded_proposer.py`.

## Proposed Implementation
- Access the Python DSPy repository.
- Navigate to `dspy/tests/propose/test_grounded_proposer.py`.
- List all test functions (e.g., `test_propose_instructions_for_program`, `test_propose_instruction_for_predictor`).
- For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding `GroundedProposer` functionality.
- Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (`dspy/tests/propose/test_grounded_proposer.py`)
- Analysis documentation (this workplan and its outputs)

## Dependencies
- Parent Epic: `../../docs/planning/workplans/TEST-ProposeGroundedProposerTests.md`
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Navigate to `dspy/tests/propose/test_grounded_proposer.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions in this file.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against `dspy/tests/propose/test_grounded_proposer.py` to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how demo candidates and trial logs are used in tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on `test_grounded_proposer.py`.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task is the first step in the TDD process for the `GroundedProposer` optimizer.
