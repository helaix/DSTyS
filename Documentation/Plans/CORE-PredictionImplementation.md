# CORE-PredictionImplementation

## Task ID
CORE-PredictionImplementation

## Problem Statement
The Prediction class is a core component of the DSTyS library, representing the output of language model predictions. We need to implement the Prediction class with TypeScript's type system and integrate it with Example, Effect for error handling and functional patterns, and ensure it supports multiple completions and LM usage tracking. The implementation must pass all the tests created in the TEST-PredictionTests task.

## Proposed Implementation
We will implement the Prediction class in TypeScript, integrating it with Example, Effect for error handling and functional patterns, and ensuring it supports multiple completions and LM usage tracking. The implementation will include:

1. Creating the Prediction class definition with TypeScript generics
2. Implementing completion management
3. Creating LM usage tracking
4. Implementing prediction manipulation utilities
5. Using Effect for error handling and functional patterns
6. Implementing serialization and deserialization

The implementation will follow these principles:
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety
- Use Effect for error handling and functional patterns
- Maintain compatibility with the Python DSPy API
- Provide a type-safe and developer-friendly API
- Support multiple completions and LM usage tracking

The Prediction implementation will serve as a foundation for all prediction modules in the system, including Predict and other prediction modules.

## Verification Steps
1. Run the Prediction tests with `npm run test src/tests/primitives/prediction.test.ts`
2. Verify that all tests pass
3. Check that the implementation follows TypeScript and Effect TS best practices
4. Verify that the Prediction class works correctly with Example
5. Ensure that the Prediction class can be used by prediction modules
6. Check that the implementation is compatible with the Python DSPy API
7. Verify that the implementation handles edge cases correctly

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Implementation details
  - TypeScript-specific adaptations
  - Utility function implementation
  - Error handling details

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python API
  - Additional features not present in Python version
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Prediction

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's inheritance from Example in TypeScript?
- What is the best way to implement completion management in TypeScript?
- How should we handle LM usage tracking with Effect?

### Non-blocking
- Exact implementation details can be refined over time
- Utility function implementation can be adjusted based on experience
- Additional features can be added as needed

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may need to adapt some Python patterns to work better with TypeScript
- Initial implementation may not include all Python features
- Some Python-specific features may need different approaches in TypeScript
- We may need to create additional utilities not present in the Python version

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The Prediction class is a fundamental building block for model outputs, so its implementation is critical
- The implementation should focus on maintaining functional equivalence while leveraging TypeScript features
- Effect TS integration is a key aspect of the TypeScript implementation
- This implementation will build on the patterns established in the previous implementations
