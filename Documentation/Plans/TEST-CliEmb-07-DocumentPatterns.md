# Workplan: Document Embedding Client Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliEmb-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the Embedding Client (`Embedder`) component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar client integrations.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Embedder.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking LiteLLM embedding calls, creating mock callable embedders), common assertion patterns for embedding arrays, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing asynchronous calls.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different embedding scenarios (LiteLLM, callable, caching, async) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/clients/Embedder.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliEmb-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `Embedder` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Embedder.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to mock LiteLLM embedding calls.
    - How to create and test with mock callable embedders.
    - Patterns for asserting embedding array results.
    - Testing caching behavior for embeddings.
    - Testing asynchronous embedding calls (especially if Effectful).
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `Embedder` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `Embedder` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps in testing other client components.
