# Workplan: Verify Reliability Zod Schema Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-RelPydMod-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Ensure that the reliability tests for Zod schema handling adequately cover the relevant aspects of `Signature`, `Field`, and `Predict` (or Adapter) logic involved in processing complex typed I/O.

## Proposed Implementation
- This task is less about line/branch coverage of a single file and more about ensuring a variety of complex Zod schema scenarios are tested.
- Review the tests in `ZodSchemas.test.ts`.
- Ensure tests cover:
    - Nested Zod objects.
    - Arrays of Zod objects.
    - Zod enums, literals, unions, optionals.
    - Correct parsing of valid LM outputs by Zod schemas.
    - Graceful failure (e.g., `AdapterParseError` or specific Zod validation errors propagated via Effect) for invalid LM outputs.
- If gaps in scenario coverage are found, add more test cases with appropriate Zod schemas and mock LM responses.

## Components Involved
- `tests/reliability/ZodSchemas.test.ts`.
- DSTyS `Signature`, `Field`, `Predict`, Adapters.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RelPydMod-04-AdaptTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `ZodSchemas.test.ts` for scenario coverage.
- [ ] Check for tests covering:
    - [ ] Basic Zod types (string, number, boolean).
    - [ ] Zod objects (simple and nested).
    - [ ] Zod arrays (of primitives and objects).
    - [ ] Zod enums and literals.
    - [ ] Zod optionals and default values.
    - [ ] Zod unions and discriminated unions.
    - [ ] Successful parsing of valid structured LM output.
    - [ ] Error handling for LM output that fails Zod schema validation.
- [ ] Add new test cases if significant scenarios are missing.

## Verification Steps
- A diverse set of Zod schema types and structures are used in tests.
- Both successful parsing and parsing failures are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May not cover every single Zod feature, but common complex patterns should be included.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Focus is on scenario coverage for Zod schema handling.
