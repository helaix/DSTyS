# Workplan: Verify Retry Logic Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-PredRetry-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once retry logic is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves target code coverage for these mechanisms.

## Proposed Implementation
- After retry logic implementation is complete and tests pass:
    - Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`.
    - Analyze coverage for retry-related source files (e.g., `Retry.ts`, or parts of `LM.ts`/`Predict.ts`).
    - Identify untested parts.
    - Write additional tests, aiming for high coverage.

## Components Involved
- Retry logic source files.
- Retry logic test files.
- Vitest coverage tools.

## Dependencies
- Retry logic implementation complete.
- All retry tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure retry logic implementation is complete and tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine coverage for relevant source files.
- [ ] If below target, add new tests.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows high coverage for retry logic.
- All critical paths in retry mechanisms are tested.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: Acceptance of coverage gaps.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- Coverage of complex retry schedules or error filtering.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Accept slightly below 100% if remaining code is trivial.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Robust retry logic needs thorough testing.
