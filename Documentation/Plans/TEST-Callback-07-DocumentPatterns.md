# Workplan: Document Callback System Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-Callback-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the Callback System component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing components that interact with or are observed by callbacks.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Callback.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., `MockCallbackHandler`, mock observable components), common assertion patterns for callback invocations and data, or specific ways Effect TS was used if applicable.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different callback events and error scenarios were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/Callback.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Callback-06-VerifyCoverage` (All Callback System tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Callback.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to use `MockCallbackHandler` to assert callback invocations.
    - How to set up tests for different callback events (module, LM, tool).
    - Testing of `ACTIVE_CALL_ID` context propagation.
    - Testing error handling in observed components and its effect on callbacks.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for Callback System tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to Callback System testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test callback-related functionality.
