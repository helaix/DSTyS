# Workplan: Document LlamaIndexRM Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-RetLI-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `LlamaIndexRM` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar retriever model integrations.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `LlamaIndexRM.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for mocking LlamaIndex.js retrievers, creating mock `NodeWithScore` objects), common assertion patterns for retrieved documents, or specific ways Effect TS was used if applicable.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how `LlamaIndexRM`'s initialization and querying were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/retrieve/LlamaIndexRM.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RetLI-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `LlamaIndexRM` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `LlamaIndexRM.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to mock the LlamaIndex.js `BaseRetriever` and its `retrieve` method.
    - How to create mock `NodeWithScore` data.
    - Patterns for asserting the list of `dspy.Example` objects returned by `LlamaIndexRM.forward`.
    - Testing of `k` parameter and other configuration options.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for `LlamaIndexRM` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `LlamaIndexRM` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps in testing other integrations with external retrieval libraries.
