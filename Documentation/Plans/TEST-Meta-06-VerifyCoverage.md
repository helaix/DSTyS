# Workplan: Verify Metadata Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-Meta-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
This task is generally Not Applicable for metadata tests in the traditional sense of code coverage. The tests assert values from configuration files, not executable code within `src/`.

## Proposed Implementation
- N/A for code coverage of a `metadata.ts` if it only re-exports `package.json` values.
- If `metadata.ts` contained significant logic (unlikely), then standard coverage analysis would apply. Assuming it's simple, this task is minimal.
- The "coverage" here is ensuring all relevant metadata fields are asserted by tests.

## Components Involved
- N/A

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Meta-04-AdaptTests` (Metadata tests implemented).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Metadata.test.ts` to ensure all key fields from `package.json` (or `metadata.ts`) are being asserted.
- [ ] If any key metadata fields are not tested, add assertions for them.
- [ ] Mark code coverage aspect as N/A or minimally applicable.

## Verification Steps
- All important metadata fields are covered by assertions in `Metadata.test.ts`.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- N/A

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Focus is on assertion coverage of metadata fields.
