# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for Tool Tests

## Task ID
TEST-TlTests-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Develop mock functions (both synchronous and asynchronous) and Zod schemas to be used in `Tool` tests. These mocks will simulate real tool functions and argument structures.

## Proposed Implementation
- Create a set of simple mock functions:
    - A synchronous function that succeeds.
    - A synchronous function that throws an error.
    - An asynchronous function that resolves.
    - An asynchronous function that rejects.
- Create corresponding Zod schemas for the arguments of these mock functions.
- Place these in `tests/utils/mocks/mockToolFunctions.ts` or directly in `Tool.test.ts` if simple enough.

## Components Involved
- `tests/utils/mocks/mockToolFunctions.ts` (or similar).
- `tests/primitives/Tool.test.ts`.
- Zod library.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-TlTests-04-AdaptTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Define `mockSyncSuccessFunc(arg1: string): string`.
- [ ] Define `mockSyncErrorFunc(arg1: string): string` (throws Error).
- [ ] Define `mockAsyncSuccessFunc(arg1: string): Promise<string>`.
- [ ] Define `mockAsyncErrorFunc(arg1: string): Promise<string>` (rejects).
- [ ] Define Zod schemas for their arguments (e.g., `z.object({ arg1: z.string() })`).
- [ ] Use these in `Tool.test.ts` when creating `Tool` instances for testing.

## Verification Steps
- Mock functions and schemas are correctly defined and usable in `Tool` tests.
- They allow for testing different execution paths of `Tool.execute`.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Mocks can be very simple, focused only on simulating success/failure of wrapped functions.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
These mocks are essential for testing `Tool.execute`'s handling of various function behaviors.
