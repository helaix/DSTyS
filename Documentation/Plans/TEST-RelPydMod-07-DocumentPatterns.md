# Workplan: Document Reliability Zod Schema Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-RelPydMod-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document the patterns and processes for testing DSTyS programs that use complex Zod schemas for defining input and output structures.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review `ZodSchemas.test.ts` and related mocks.
- Document:
    - How to define DSTyS `Signature`s with `Field`s typed by complex Zod schemas.
    - How to create mock input data conforming to these Zod schemas.
    - How to create mock LM string outputs (e.g., JSON) designed to be parsed by output Zod schemas.
    - Patterns for asserting successful parsing and validation of Zod-typed outputs.
    - Patterns for testing error handling when LM output fails Zod validation.
    - Use of a judge LM for validating the semantic correctness of Zod-parsed outputs, if applicable.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/reliability/ZodSchemas.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RelPydMod-06-VerifyCoverage`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review Zod schema reliability tests.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Clear documentation helps in writing robust tests for programs with complex data structures.
