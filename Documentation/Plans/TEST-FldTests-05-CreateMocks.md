# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for Field Tests

## Task ID
TEST-FldTests-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
Identify and create any necessary mock implementations or test utilities required for the `Field` tests. While `Field` itself is a primitive, its tests might involve interactions with Zod schemas or other simple constructs that benefit from controlled test versions.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the converted `Field` tests from `TEST-FldTests-04-AdaptTests`.
- Identify if any external dependencies (unlikely for `Field` itself, but good practice to check) or complex internal states need mocking for isolated testing.
- For `Field` tests, this primarily involves ensuring Zod schemas used in tests are well-defined and representative.
- Create helper functions if needed for repeatedly setting up `Field` instances with specific configurations for tests.
- Testing: Mocks and utilities should be simple and directly support the tests.

## Components Involved
- `tests/signatures/Field.test.ts` (or a shared test utilities file).
- Zod library (for defining test schemas).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-FldTests-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests that might reveal need for mocks).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Field` tests for any complex setup or dependencies.
- [ ] Define standard Zod schemas to be used in multiple `Field` tests (e.g., `z.string()`, `z.number()`, a simple `z.object()`).
- [ ] Create helper functions if there's repetitive `Field` instantiation logic in tests, e.g.:
  ```typescript
  // const createTestField = (type: ZodType, desc: string, prefix?: string) => new Field(type, { description: desc, prefix });
  ```
- [ ] Ensure mocks (if any) are correctly integrated into tests (e.g., via `vi.mock` or by passing mock instances).

## Verification Steps
- Mocks and test utilities simplify test code and improve readability.
- Tests using mocks correctly isolate the unit under test.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Implementation details of mocks and utilities.
- User Input: None anticipated for `Field` tests.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None, as `Field` is fairly self-contained.

### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Avoid over-mocking; `Field` tests should generally test the real `Field` object.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
For `Field`, this task is likely minimal, focusing on test data and schema setup.
