# Workplan: Identify Python Example Tests

## Task ID
TEST-ExTests-01-IdentifyTests

## Problem Statement
Locate and list all Python test files and specific test cases within the DSPy repository that are relevant to the functionality of the `dspy.Example` class. This forms the basis for the test conversion effort.

## Proposed Implementation
- Thoroughly examine the `tests/primitives/test_example.py` file in the Python DSPy repository.
- Identify any other test files that might implicitly test `dspy.Example` functionality through its usage in other components (though primary focus is on direct tests).
- Create a checklist or list of all Python test functions/methods related to `Example` (e.g., `test_example_initialization`, `test_example_with_inputs`, etc.).
- For each identified test, briefly note its purpose or the specific `Example` feature it targets.
- Testing: This task is investigative; verification involves confirming that the list of identified tests is comprehensive.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (specifically `tests/primitives/test_example.py`).
- Analysis and documentation tools (e.g., text editor, spreadsheet).

## Dependencies
- Access to the Python DSPy repository.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Navigate to `tests/primitives/test_example.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions (e.g., methods starting with `test_`) in this file.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding `dspy.Example`.
- [ ] Briefly scan other test files in `tests/primitives` or `tests/signatures` for significant, direct tests of `Example` instantiation or core methods (less likely, but good to check).
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases to be ported.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against `test_example.py` to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: How to organize the list of identified tests.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- Some Python tests might rely on other primitives; note these dependencies.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on `test_example.py`; extensive searching in unrelated files is likely low yield.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
A clear inventory of existing Python tests is the first step to ensuring comprehensive test coverage in the TypeScript port.
