# Workplan: Document Field Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-FldTests-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the `Field` component. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing similar primitives.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Field.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions, common assertion patterns, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing `Field` validation.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how `Field` properties and validation logic were tested.
- Testing: The documentation should be clear and accurately reflect the test implementation.

## Components Involved
- `tests/signatures/Field.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-FldTests-06-VerifyCoverage` (All `Field` tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Field.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How `Field` instantiation with different parameters is tested.
    - How metadata properties (description, prefix) are asserted.
    - How Zod schema integration and validation (especially with Effect) are tested.
    - Any helper functions created for `Field` tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to `Field` testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps onboard new developers.
