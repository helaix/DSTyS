# Workplan: Document Signature Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-SigTests-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document specific patterns, utilities, or approaches used in testing the `Signature` component, especially regarding string/class-based definitions, Effect TS for validation, and Zod schema interactions.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review `Signature.test.ts`.
- Identify patterns for:
    - Testing string-based signature parsing (and its Effect outcome).
    - Testing class-based signature definition.
    - Asserting field collections and instruction handling.
    - Testing whole-signature validation with Zod and Effect.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/signatures/Signature.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-SigTests-06-VerifyCoverage` (`Signature` tests finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Signature.test.ts`.
- [ ] Document:
    - Testing `Signature.fromString` (or equivalent) and its `Effect` result.
    - Testing the chosen pattern for class-based signatures.
    - Testing `validateInputs`/`validateOutputs` and their `Effect` results.
    - Helper functions or mock `Field` utilities used.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- Documented patterns are clear and accurate.
- Examples are correct.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Concise documentation.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Aids consistency in testing components that define or consume `Signature` objects.
