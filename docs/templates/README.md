# DSTy Project Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for the DSTy project development workflow.

## Available Templates

### 1. [Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template](./product_requirements_document_template.md)

The PRD template is designed to help define what you're building and why. It establishes clear requirements and success metrics for features and components of the DSTy project.

#### How to Use the PRD Template

1. **Start with stream-of-consciousness recording**:
   - Record your thoughts about the product vision
   - Don't worry about structure at this stage
   - Focus on capturing what you're trying to build and why

2. **Transcribe and organize**:
   - Convert your recording into text
   - Begin organizing thoughts into the template sections
   - Identify areas that need more development

3. **Refine into structured document**:
   - Fill in all sections of the template
   - Ensure all key components are addressed
   - Review for clarity and completeness

4. **Review with stakeholders**:
   - Share the draft with key stakeholders
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any conflicting requirements

5. **Finalize the document**:
   - Update based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

### 2. [Architecture Document Template](./architecture_document_template.md)

The Architecture Document template is designed to define how you'll build the product, establishing the technical foundation and implementation approach for the DSTy project.

#### How to Use the Architecture Document Template

1. **Review the PRD**:
   - Understand the requirements and constraints
   - Identify key functional and non-functional requirements
   - Note any technical constraints or preferences

2. **Evaluate technology options**:
   - Research suitable technologies for the project
   - Compare alternatives based on project needs
   - Justify your technology choices

3. **Draft architecture with diagrams**:
   - Create high-level design with components and interactions
   - Use diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) to illustrate the architecture
   - Ensure all major components are represented

4. **Define API contracts and data models**:
   - Document API endpoints, methods, and data structures
   - Create entity relationship diagrams
   - Define data schemas and relationships

5. **Document non-functional requirements implementation**:
   - Address performance considerations
   - Include security measures
   - Plan for scalability and reliability
   - Outline maintainability approaches

6. **Outline testing strategy**:
   - Define test-driven development approach
   - Include unit, integration, and system testing plans
   - Document test environments and data management

7. **Review with technical stakeholders**:
   - Share the draft with technical team members
   - Collect and incorporate feedback
   - Resolve any technical concerns or conflicts

8. **Finalize the document**:
   - Update based on feedback
   - Get final approvals
   - Distribute to the implementation team

## Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive documentation:

1. **Document Information**: Version tracking and ownership
2. **Key Sections**: Specific to each template type
3. **Appendices**: Supporting information, glossary, and revision history
4. **Usage Notes**: Guidelines on effectively using the template
