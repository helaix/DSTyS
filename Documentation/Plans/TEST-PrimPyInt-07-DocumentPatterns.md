# Workplan: Document JS Interpreter Test Patterns (If Applicable)

## Task ID
TEST-PrimPyInt-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
If a JavaScript/TypeScript interpreter tool is implemented, document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing it. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference.

## Proposed Implementation
- **Conditional on implementing a JS Interpreter tool.**
- Review the completed `JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating diverse code snippets), common assertion patterns for execution results or errors, or specific ways Effect TS was used for testing the interpreter.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different interpreter scenarios (e.g., successful execution, syntax errors, runtime errors, variable injection) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` (conditional).
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PrimPyInt-06-VerifyCoverage` (All JS Interpreter tests are complete and finalized, if applicable).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is in scope:
    - [ ] Review `JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
    - [ ] Document:
        - How to create and use various JS code snippets for testing.
        - Patterns for asserting successful execution results.
        - Testing different types of errors (syntax, runtime) and their handling.
        - How variable injection is tested.
        - Any helper functions created specifically for JS Interpreter tests.
    - [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is out of scope, mark this task as N/A.

## Verification Steps
- If applicable, the documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Decision on implementing a JS interpreter.

### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to JS Interpreter testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability.
