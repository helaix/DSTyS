# Workplan: Adapt Field Tests for TypeScript & Effect

## Task ID
TEST-FldTests-04-AdaptTests

## Problem Statement
Convert the logic and assertions from the Python `Field` tests into the placeholder TypeScript/Vitest test cases. This involves translating Python code to TypeScript, adapting for static typing, and integrating Effect TS patterns for any `Field` operations that are effectful (e.g., validation).

## Proposed Implementation
- For each placeholder test in `tests/signatures/Field.test.ts`:
    - Translate the corresponding Python test logic into TypeScript.
    - Define necessary input data and expected outcomes in TypeScript.
    - Use `expect` assertions from Vitest.
    - If `Field` methods (like a potential `field.validate(value)`) return `Effect` objects:
        - Use `Effect.runPromiseExit` or `@effect/vitest` helpers to test success and failure paths.
        - Assert on the `Exit` state (Success/Failure) and the contained value or error tag.
    - Ensure type safety in test code.
- Testing: Each converted test should accurately reflect the intent of the original Python test and pass when the `Field` implementation is correct.

## Components Involved
- `tests/signatures/Field.test.ts`.
- TypeScript, Vitest, Effect.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-FldTests-03-CreateTSFiles` (Placeholder test files).
- `CORE-FieldImpl-01-TypeDef` (Initial `Field` type definition, even if partial, to write tests against).
- `CORE-FieldImpl-03-ZodIntegration` and `CORE-FieldImpl-04-EffectIntegration` (if testing validation).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Iterate through each placeholder test in `Field.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement the test logic based on the original Python test.
    - Define `Field` instances as they would be in DSTyS.
    - Call `Field` methods or access properties.
    - Use `expect(...).toEqual(...)`, `expect(...).toThrow(...)` (or Effect error checks).
- [ ] For tests involving validation (if `Field.validate` is effectful):
    - Test success cases: `Effect.runPromiseExit(field.validate(validValue))` should yield `Exit.Success` with the correct value.
    - Test failure cases: `Effect.runPromiseExit(field.validate(invalidValue))` should yield `Exit.Failure` with the correct `FieldValidationError` tag.
- [ ] Ensure all tests are self-contained and do not rely on external state beyond mocks.

## Verification Steps
- All converted `Field` tests should initially fail (as the `Field` implementation is not yet complete).
- Test logic should be clear and directly test the intended `Field` behavior.
- Type errors in test code should be resolved.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Specific assertion styles, test data generation.
- User Input: Clarification on Python test behavior if ambiguous.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- How `Field` validation will be exposed (e.g., `field.validate(value)` returning an `Effect`). This depends on `CORE-FieldImpl-03-ZodIntegration`.

### Non-blocking
- Refinements to error messages or specific validation details.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Some tests might need to be marked as `.skip` or `.todo` if they depend on parts of `Field` not yet designed/implemented.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This is the core task of test conversion for the `Field` component.
