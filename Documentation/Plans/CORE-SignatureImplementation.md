# CORE-SignatureImplementation

## Task ID
CORE-SignatureImplementation

## Problem Statement
The Signature class is a core component of the DSTyS library, used to define the structure of inputs and outputs for modules. We need to implement the Signature class with TypeScript's type system and integrate it with Field types, Zod for runtime validation, and Effect for error handling. The implementation must pass all the tests created in the TEST-SignatureTests task.

## Proposed Implementation
We will implement the Signature class in TypeScript, integrating it with Field types, Zod for runtime validation, and Effect for error handling. The implementation will include:

1. Creating the Signature class definition with TypeScript generics
2. Implementing input and output field management
3. Creating signature creation and manipulation utilities
4. Integrating with Zod for runtime validation
5. Using Effect for error handling
6. Implementing signature metadata and documentation

The implementation will follow these principles:
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Integrate Effect for error handling and functional patterns
- Maintain compatibility with the Python DSPy API
- Provide a type-safe and developer-friendly API

The Signature implementation will serve as a foundation for other components, particularly the Module class.

- [ ] Create signature creation utilities
  - [ ] Implement string-based signature creation
  - [ ] Create class-based signature definition
  - [ ] Implement signature inheritance
- [ ] Integrate with Zod
  - [ ] Create Zod schema integration
  - [ ] Implement validation logic
  - [ ] Handle validation errors
- [ ] Implement Effect integration
  - [ ] Use Effect for error handling
  - [ ] Create Effect-based validation
  - [ ] Implement functional patterns

## Verification Steps
1. Run the Signature tests with `npm run test src/tests/signatures/signature.test.ts`
2. Verify that all tests pass
3. Check that the implementation follows TypeScript and Effect TS best practices
4. Verify that the Signature class works correctly with Field types
5. Ensure that the Signature class can be used in other components
6. Check that the implementation is compatible with the Python DSPy API
7. Verify that the implementation handles edge cases correctly

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Implementation details
  - TypeScript-specific adaptations
  - Utility function implementation
  - Error handling details

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python API
  - Additional features not present in Python version
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Signature

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's metaclass functionality in TypeScript?
- What is the best way to implement class-based signature definition in TypeScript?
- How should we handle signature inheritance and composition?

### Non-blocking
- Exact implementation details can be refined over time
- Utility function implementation can be adjusted based on experience
- Additional features can be added as needed

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- We may need to adapt some Python patterns to work better with TypeScript
- Initial implementation may not include all Python features
- Some Python-specific features may need different approaches in TypeScript
- We may need to create additional utilities not present in the Python version

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- The Signature class is a fundamental building block of the library, so its implementation is critical
- The implementation should focus on maintaining functional equivalence while leveraging TypeScript features
- Effect TS integration is a key aspect of the TypeScript implementation
- This implementation will build on the patterns established in the Field implementation
