# Workplan: Create Mock Implementations for JS Interpreter Tests (If Applicable)

## Task ID
TEST-PrimPyInt-05-CreateMocks

## Problem Statement
If a JavaScript/TypeScript interpreter tool is implemented, identify and create necessary mock code snippets or test utilities for its tests.

## Proposed Implementation
- **Conditional on implementing a JS Interpreter tool.**
- Review the converted JS Interpreter tests from `TEST-PrimPyInt-04-AdaptTests`.
- Create various JavaScript code snippets to be used as input for the interpreter tests:
    - Simple expressions (e.g., `1 + 1`).
    - Code that defines and uses variables.
    - Code that uses `final_answer`-like mechanism (if implemented).
    - Code that should produce syntax errors.
    - Code that should produce runtime errors.
- These snippets will be passed to the `interpreter.execute()` method in tests.
- Place these snippets directly in test files or in a helper file if they become numerous.

## Components Involved
- `tests/primitives/JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts` (conditional).
- JavaScript code snippets.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-PrimPyInt-04-AdaptTests` (Converted tests will drive the need for specific code snippets).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is in scope:
    - [ ] Define various JS code strings for testing:
        - Simple arithmetic.
        - Variable assignments and usage.
        - Function definitions and calls.
        - Code that accesses injected variables.
        - Code that uses `final_answer` (if applicable).
        - Code with syntax errors.
        - Code with runtime errors (e.g., undefined variable, division by zero).
    - [ ] Integrate these snippets into `JavaScriptInterpreter.test.ts`.
- [ ] If JS Interpreter is out of scope, mark this task as N/A.

## Verification Steps
- If applicable, mock code snippets are correctly defined and used in tests.
- Snippets cover a range of execution paths (success, syntax error, runtime error).

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Content of mock code snippets.
- User Input: None anticipated.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Decision on implementing a JS interpreter.

### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Snippets can be simple and focused on testing specific interpreter behaviors.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
These code snippets are the primary "mock data" for testing an interpreter.
