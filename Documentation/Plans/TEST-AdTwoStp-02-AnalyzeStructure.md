# Workplan: Analyze TwoStep Adapter Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-AdTwoStp-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for `dspy.TwoStepAdapter`. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how the two-step (generation and extraction) process is tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for `TwoStepAdapter` from `TEST-AdTwoStp-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking interactions with both main and extraction LMs, verifying intermediate and final outputs, handling of different signature types).
- Identify how Python's dynamic features are used in `TwoStepAdapter` tests and how these might translate to TypeScript.
- Note any dependencies on other DSPy components (like `Signature`, `LM`).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic, especially for mocking two different LMs.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `TwoStepAdapter` test cases from `dspy/tests/adapters/test_two_step_adapter.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-AdTwoStp-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for `TwoStepAdapter`).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python `TwoStepAdapter` test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made (for both steps).
    - [ ] Note how `TwoStepAdapter` instances and their LMs are created and configured.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific features.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `TwoStepAdapter` methods.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python `TwoStepAdapter` tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding how the internal signature for the extraction step is created and tested.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `TwoStepAdapter`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and necessary mocks for the TwoStep Adapter.
