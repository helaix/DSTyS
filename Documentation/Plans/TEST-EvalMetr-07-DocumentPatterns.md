# Workplan: Document Evaluation Metrics Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-EvalMetr-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the evaluation metrics. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for creating new metrics or testing components that use metrics.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Metrics.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock `Example` and `Prediction` objects), common assertion patterns for metric scores, or specific ways edge cases were handled.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different metric scenarios (e.g., match, no match, partial match) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/evaluate/Metrics.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-EvalMetr-06-VerifyCoverage` (All evaluation metrics tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Metrics.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock `Example` and `Prediction` data for metric tests.
    - Patterns for asserting metric scores (boolean, numerical).
    - Testing different scenarios for each core metric.
    - How text normalization or other pre-processing is handled in tests if it's part of the metric.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for metrics tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to metrics testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test and create new evaluation metrics.
