## Migration Steps for Existing Workplans

To migrate existing workplans to this structure, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Existing Workplans**:
   - Review all workplan documents in `docs/planning/workplans/`
   - Create an inventory with workplan IDs, titles, and status

2. **Create Epic Structure**:
   - Create epics for major features or components
   - Link related workplans to each epic

3. **Create Workplan Issues**:
   - Create Linear issues for each workplan document
   - Follow the structure outlined above
   - Link to the appropriate epic

4. **Create Task Issues**:
   - Create sub-issues for each task in the workplans
   - Link to the appropriate workplan
   - Set dependencies between tasks

5. **Apply Metadata**:
   - Add labels to all issues
   - Fill in custom fields
   - Set appropriate status

6. **Verify Structure**:
   - Ensure all relationships are correctly established
   - Verify that the hierarchy is consistent
   - Check that all metadata is correctly applied

## Conclusion

This sample implementation demonstrates how to apply the Linear structure to an existing workplan. By following this example, you can create a consistent, scalable system for representing workplans in Linear that maintains alignment with the documentation templates while supporting effective project management.
