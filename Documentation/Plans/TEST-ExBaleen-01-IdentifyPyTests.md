# Workplan: Identify Python Baleen Example Tests

## Task ID
TEST-ExBaleen-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
To understand how complex example programs like Baleen are tested in Python DSPy, we must first comprehensively identify all relevant Python test cases from `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`.

## Proposed Implementation
- Access the Python DSPy repository.
- Navigate to `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`.
- List all test functions (e.g., `test_baleen`, `test_compiled_baleen`).
- For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests regarding the Baleen example (e.g., uncompiled execution, compiled execution, specific metrics like `gold_passages_retrieved`).
- Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (`dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`)
- Analysis documentation (this workplan and its outputs)

## Dependencies
- Parent Epic: `../../docs/planning/workplans/TEST-ExamplesBaleenTests.md`
- `TEST-Framework` (for understanding test environment)
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate` (for general conversion guidelines)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone or access the Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Navigate to `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py`.
- [ ] List all test functions in this file.
- [ ] For each test function, write a one-sentence summary of what it tests.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases.

## Verification Steps
- Review the generated list of Python tests against `dspy/tests/examples/test_baleen.py` to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that the purpose of each identified Python test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: How to organize the list of identified tests.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- Understanding dependencies on `HotPotQA` dataset and specific LMs/RMs used in tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus primarily on `test_baleen.py`.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This task is the first step in analyzing tests for a complex example program.
