# Exa Web Search Tool (`mcp_exa_web_search`)

This tool performs real-time web searches using the Exa AI engine. It's useful for finding current information, news, documentation updates, or external resources related to the project or technologies being used.

## How it Works

-   Provide a search `query` string. Be specific for better results (e.g., "TanStack Router file-based routing examples", "latest pnpm version").
-   (Optional) Specify `numResults` (default is 5) to control how many search results are returned.
-   The tool returns a list of relevant web pages, often including titles, URLs, publication dates, and text snippets from the page content.

## Example Usage

To search for the latest release notes for TanStack Router and get 3 results:

```
mcp_exa_web_search(query="latest release notes for TanStack Router", numResults=3)
```
