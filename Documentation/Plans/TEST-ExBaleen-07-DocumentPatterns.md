# Workplan: Document Baleen Example Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-ExBaleen-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document specific patterns or utilities used in testing the Baleen example program, especially regarding mocking multi-hop LM/RM interactions and custom metrics.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review `Baleen.test.ts`.
- Document:
    - How multi-stage LM responses were mocked.
    - How RM responses were mocked.
    - Implementation of custom metrics in TypeScript.
    - Setup for testing compiled vs. uncompiled versions.
- Update `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or testing guide.

## Components Involved
- `tests/examples/Baleen.test.ts`.
- Project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-ExBaleen-06-VerifyCoverage`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Baleen.test.ts`.
- [ ] Document patterns for testing multi-hop programs.
- [ ] Add to testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- Documented patterns are clear and accurate.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.
