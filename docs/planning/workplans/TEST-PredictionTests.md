# Epic Overview: Prediction Tests Conversion (TEST-PredictionTests)

## Task ID
TEST-PredictionTests (Epic)

## Problem Statement
To implement DSTyS using a test-driven development approach, we need to convert the Python DSPy tests for the Prediction class to TypeScript with Effect TS integration. These tests will serve as the specification for the Prediction implementation and ensure feature parity with the Python version while leveraging TypeScript's type system and Effect's functional programming patterns.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will convert the Python tests for the Prediction class to TypeScript, adapting them to work with the TypeScript type system and Effect TS patterns. The process involves:
1. Analyzing Python Prediction tests.
2. Re-implementing these tests in TypeScript using Vitest.
3. Adapting test logic for TypeScript's static typing and handling of completions.
4. Creating necessary mocks (e.g., for `Example`, `Signature` if `Prediction` interacts with them).
The converted tests will guide the `CORE-PredictionImplementation`.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Vitest testing framework
- TypeScript test files for `Prediction`
- Mocks for dependencies
- Effect TS testing patterns (if `Prediction` methods become effectful)

## Dependencies (Original)
- SETUP-ProjectStructure (must be completed first)
- SETUP-DependencyManagement (must be completed first)
- TEST-Framework (Vitest setup, Effect test utilities)
- TEST-ConversionTemplate (guidelines for test conversion)
- TEST-FieldTests & CORE-FieldImplementation
- TEST-SignatureTests & CORE-SignatureImplementation
- TEST-ExampleTests & CORE-ExampleImplementation
- TEST-ModuleTests & CORE-ModuleImplementation

## Granular Workplans
- [TEST-PredTests-01-IdentifyPyTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-01-IdentifyPyTests.md) - Identify Python Prediction tests
- [TEST-PredTests-02-AnalyzeStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-02-AnalyzeStructure.md) - Analyze test structure and patterns
- [TEST-PredTests-03-CreateTSFiles](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-03-CreateTSFiles.md) - Create TypeScript test files
- [TEST-PredTests-04-AdaptTests](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-04-AdaptTests.md) - Adapt tests for TypeScript & Effect
- [TEST-PredTests-05-CreateMocks](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-05-CreateMocks.md) - Create mock implementations
- [TEST-PredTests-06-VerifyCoverage](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-06-VerifyCoverage.md) - Verify test coverage
- [TEST-PredTests-07-DocumentPatterns](../../Documentation/Plans/TEST-PredTests-07-DocumentPatterns.md) - Document test patterns

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Test file organization and naming.
  - Test utility implementation details.
  - Mock implementation details.
  - TypeScript-specific test adaptations.

- Requires user input:
  - Any significant deviations from Python test coverage.
  - Additional test cases not present in Python version.
  - Changes to the expected behavior of Prediction.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- How should we handle Python's inheritance from Example in TypeScript for `Prediction`?
- How should we integrate Effect TS patterns for handling completions if `Prediction` methods become effectful?
- How should we handle Python's dynamic attribute access in TypeScript?

### Non-blocking
- Exact test organization can be refined over time.
- Test utility implementation details can be adjusted based on experience.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- We may need to adapt some Python test patterns to work better with TypeScript.
- Initial test coverage may not be 100% identical to Python version.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The Prediction class is fundamental for model outputs; its tests are critical.
- Test conversion should focus on maintaining functional equivalence.
