# Workplan: Verify Evaluate Utility Test Coverage

## Task ID
TEST-EvalEval-06-VerifyCoverage

## Problem Statement
Once the `Evaluate` utility is implemented and its tests pass, verify that the test suite achieves the target code coverage for this utility.

## Proposed Implementation
- After the `Evaluate` utility implementation is complete and all tests in `TEST-EvalEval-04-AdaptTests` (and any subsequently added tests) are passing:
    - Run the test suite with coverage reporting enabled (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`).
    - Analyze the coverage report specifically for `source/evaluate/Evaluate.ts` (or relevant file).
    - Identify any untested lines, branches, or functions.
    - Write additional tests to cover these gaps, if critical, aiming for >85-90% coverage.

## Components Involved
- `source/evaluate/Evaluate.ts` (or relevant implementation file).
- `tests/evaluate/Evaluate.test.ts` (the tests).
- Vitest coverage reporting tools.

## Dependencies
- `CORE-EvaluateImplementation` (Full implementation of the Evaluate utility - conceptual name).
- All `Evaluate` utility tests passing.
- `TEST-Framework` (Coverage reporting setup).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Ensure `Evaluate` utility implementation is complete and all existing tests pass.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`.
- [ ] Examine the coverage report for the `Evaluate` source file.
- [ ] If coverage is below target (e.g., 85%):
    - [ ] Identify specific lines/branches not covered.
    - [ ] Write new test cases in `Evaluate.test.ts` to cover these gaps.
    - [ ] Re-run coverage until target is met or remaining gaps are justified as non-critical.

## Verification Steps
- Coverage report shows target coverage (e.g., >85%) for the `Evaluate` utility.
- All critical paths and functionalities of `Evaluate` are covered by tests.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Writing additional tests.
- User Input: Acceptance of any coverage gaps if 100% is not feasible/practical.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None, assuming implementation and basic tests are done.

### Non-blocking
- Coverage of error handling paths or complex display logic.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- May accept slightly below 100% coverage if the remaining uncovered code is trivial or extremely defensive.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good test coverage ensures the `Evaluate` utility is reliable for program assessment and optimization.
