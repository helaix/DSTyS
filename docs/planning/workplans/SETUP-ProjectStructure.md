# Epic Overview: Project Structure Setup (SETUP-ProjectStructure)

## Task ID
SETUP-ProjectStructure (Epic)

## Problem Statement
The DSTyS project requires a well-structured foundation to ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of development. We need to set up the initial project structure, build system, and CI/CD pipeline to enable efficient development and ensure code quality throughout the project lifecycle.

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
We will set up a modern TypeScript project structure using ESM modules, with a comprehensive build system and CI/CD pipeline. The setup will include:
- Defining a clear project directory structure.
- Configuring TypeScript for optimal settings.
- Setting up linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier/Biome) for code consistency.
- Configuring the Vitest testing framework.
- Establishing a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
- Initializing `package.json` for dependencies and scripts.
- Setting up documentation generation tools (e.g., TypeDoc).
- Creating essential project files like READMEs and example structures.

The project will likely use a monorepo-like structure if sub-packages are anticipated, or a standard library structure. Testing will be a core part, with CI ensuring tests, linting, and type checks pass on every PR.

## Components Involved (High-Level)
- Project directory layout
- Build system (npm/yarn/pnpm scripts, TypeScript compiler, bundler if needed)
- Testing infrastructure (Vitest)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier/Biome)
- Documentation tools (TypeDoc)
- Package management (`package.json`)

## Dependencies (Original)
- Node.js 20+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- ESM module system
- Effect library (as a core dependency to consider in setup)
- Zod library (as a core dependency)
- Vitest testing framework
- ESLint and Prettier/Biome
- GitHub Actions

## Granular Workplans
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-01-DirStructure](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-01-DirStructure.md) - Create basic directory structure
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-02-TSConfig](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-02-TSConfig.md) - Configure TypeScript
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-03-LintFormat](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-03-LintFormat.md) - Set up ESLint and Prettier/Biome
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-04-Testing](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-04-Testing.md) - Configure testing with Vitest
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-05-CICD](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-05-CICD.md) - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-06-PackageJson](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-06-PackageJson.md) - Configure package.json
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-07-DocsGen](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-07-DocsGen.md) - Set up documentation generation
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-08-README](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-08-README.md) - Create README.md with project overview
- [SETUP-ProjStruct-09-Examples](../../Documentation/Plans/SETUP-ProjStruct-09-Examples.md) - Set up example files

## Decision Authority (Original)
- Independent decisions:
  - Specific directory layout choices (within common best practices).
  - Choice of specific ESLint/Prettier rules.
  - Detailed GitHub Actions workflow steps.
  - Documentation structure.

- Requires user input:
  - Choice of package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm).
  - Minimum supported Node.js version if more specific than "20+".
  - Overall monorepo vs. single-package strategy if not already decided.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Original)

### Blocking
- Final decision on package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) if not already made.
- Decision on publishing strategy (npm public, private registry) as it might influence `package.json` setup.

### Non-blocking
- Specific ESLint rules can be adjusted later.
- Documentation generation format can be refined.
- CI/CD pipeline can be enhanced iteratively.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs (Original)
- May start with a simpler CI/CD pipeline and enhance it over time.
- Initial documentation setup might be basic, focusing on API reference generation.
- Advanced monorepo tooling (like Turborepo) might be deferred if not immediately necessary.
- Choice of SWC vs. tsc for compilation can be decided based on initial speed/complexity balance.

## Status
In Progress (Refactored into granular tasks)

## Notes
- The project structure should be designed to accommodate future growth and contributions.
- Prioritize developer experience (DX) and ease of contribution.
- The build system should be optimized for both development and production/library use cases.
