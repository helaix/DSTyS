## Notes on Using This Template

This Architecture Document template follows the process outlined in the issue:
1. Review the PRD to understand requirements
2. Evaluate technology options based on project needs
3. Draft architecture with diagrams showing system components
4. Define API contracts and data models
5. Document non-functional requirements implementation
6. Outline testing strategy
7. Review with technical stakeholders

Remember that a good Architecture Document should:
- Clearly explain the technical foundation of the project
- Justify technology choices
- Provide detailed diagrams of system components and interactions
- Define clear API contracts and data models
- Address non-functional requirements like performance, security, and scalability
- Outline a comprehensive testing strategy
- Be reviewed and approved by technical stakeholders before implementation begins
