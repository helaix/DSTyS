# Workplan: Analyze PgVectorRM Integration Test Structure

## Task ID
TEST-RetPgVecI-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure of Python integration tests for `PgVectorRM`, focusing on database setup, data management, `PgVectorRM` interaction, and result validation.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test scenario for `PgVectorRM`.
- Document:
    - How `pytest` fixtures (`setup_pgvectorrm`) manage database connections and test table lifecycle (creation, population, cleanup).
    - How test data (text and embeddings) is inserted into the PgVector table.
    - How `PgVectorRM` is initialized with database connection details.
    - How queries are performed and results (retrieved documents, similarity scores) are asserted.
- Identify challenges for replicating this with a TypeScript PostgreSQL client and Vitest.

## Components Involved
- Python `PgVectorRM` integration test cases.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-RetPgVecI-01-IdentifyPyTests`.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each Python test scenario:
    - [ ] Detail the database setup (SQL for table creation, data insertion).
    - [ ] Document `PgVectorRM` instantiation and querying.
    - [ ] Analyze assertions on retrieved `Example` objects and similarity scores.
    - [ ] Note database cleanup procedures.
- [ ] List key challenges for TypeScript (e.g., managing test DB lifecycle, async DB calls, embedding generation for test data).

## Verification Steps
- Analysis accurately describes the Python PgVectorRM integration test structure.
- Conversion challenges are identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- How mock embeddings are generated or handled in Python tests.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on the core database interaction and assertion patterns.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Understanding the database interaction patterns is key for TypeScript integration tests.
