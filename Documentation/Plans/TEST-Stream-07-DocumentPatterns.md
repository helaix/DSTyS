# Workplan: Document Streaming Test Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-Stream-07-DocumentPatterns

## Problem Statement
Document any specific patterns, utilities, or notable approaches used in testing the streaming functionalities. This documentation will help maintain consistency and serve as a reference for testing components that produce or consume streams.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review the completed `Streaming.test.ts` file.
- Identify any reusable helper functions (e.g., for creating mock streaming LMs, collecting streamed chunks), common assertion patterns for streamed data, or specific ways Effect `Stream` or async iterators were tested.
- Update the `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a dedicated testing guide within `docs/` with these patterns.
- Include examples of how different streaming scenarios (`streamify`, `StreamListener`, status messages) were tested.

## Components Involved
- `tests/streaming/Streaming.test.ts`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a new testing guide).

## Dependencies
- `TEST-Stream-06-VerifyCoverage` (All streaming tests are complete and finalized).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review `Streaming.test.ts` for common patterns or unique testing approaches.
- [ ] Document:
    - How to set up mock LMs that produce streaming output.
    - Patterns for consuming and asserting streamed chunks (e.g., collecting into an array, checking order and content).
    - Testing `StreamListener` behavior.
    - Testing status message generation and content.
    - Any helper functions created specifically for streaming tests.
- [ ] Add these documented patterns as examples or guidelines to `TEST-ConversionTemplate.md` or a relevant section in the project's testing documentation.

## Verification Steps
- The documented patterns are clear, accurate, and useful for future test development.
- Examples provided are correct and illustrative.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Format and location of the documentation.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Documentation can be concise, focusing on patterns unique or particularly relevant to streaming testing.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
Good documentation of testing patterns improves maintainability and helps developers understand how to test asynchronous streaming logic.
