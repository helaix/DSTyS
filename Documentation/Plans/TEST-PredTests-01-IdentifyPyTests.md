# Workplan: Identify Python Prediction Tests

## Task ID
TEST-PredTests-01-IdentifyPyTests

## Problem Statement
Locate and list all Python test files and specific test cases within the DSPy repository that are relevant to the functionality of the `dspy.Prediction` class and its associated `Completions` class.

## Proposed Implementation
- Examine `tests/primitives/test_example.py` (as `Prediction` inherits from `Example` in Python DSPy) and any other files that test `Prediction` or `Completions` directly.
- List all test functions/methods related to `Prediction` (instantiation, completion management, LM usage tracking, manipulation utilities, serialization).
- Note the purpose of each test.

## Components Involved
- Python DSPy codebase (e.g., `tests/primitives/test_example.py`, potentially others).
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- Access to Python DSPy repository.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clone/access Python DSPy repository.
- [ ] Review `tests/primitives/test_example.py` for tests specifically targeting `Prediction` behavior beyond `Example` behavior.
- [ ] Search for other tests of `dspy.Prediction` or `dspy.Completions`.
- [ ] List all relevant test functions.
- [ ] Summarize the purpose of each test regarding `Prediction` functionality.
- [ ] Compile the final list of Python test cases for `Prediction`.

## Verification Steps
- The list of Python tests for `Prediction` is comprehensive.
- The purpose of each test is understood.

## Decision Authority
- Independent.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- Differentiating tests for `Prediction`'s own features vs. inherited `Example` features.
### Non-blocking
- None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on tests exercising unique `Prediction` capabilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This inventory is crucial for porting `Prediction` tests.
