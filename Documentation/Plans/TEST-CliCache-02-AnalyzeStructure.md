# Workplan: Analyze dspy.cache Test Structure and Patterns

## Task ID
TEST-CliCache-02-AnalyzeStructure

## Problem Statement
Analyze the structure and common patterns used in the identified Python tests for `dspy.cache`. This understanding is crucial for planning the TypeScript conversion, especially regarding how different cache types (memory, disk), cache key generation, and the `@request_cache` decorator are tested.

## Proposed Implementation
- Review each identified Python test case for `dspy.cache` from `TEST-CliCache-01-IdentifyPyTests`.
- Document common assertion patterns (e.g., checking cache hits/misses, verifying cache contents, testing cache key uniqueness, behavior of decorated functions).
- Identify how Python's features (like `pytest` fixtures for temporary directories, `unittest.mock.patch`) are used and how these might translate to TypeScript/Vitest.
- Note any dependencies on external caching libraries (`cachetools`, `diskcache`).
- Identify any complex setup or teardown logic for cache state.

## Components Involved
- Identified Python `dspy.cache` test cases from `dspy/tests/clients/test_cache.py`.
- Analysis documentation.

## Dependencies
- `TEST-CliCache-01-IdentifyPyTests` (List of Python tests for `dspy.cache`).
- `TEST-Framework`
- `TEST-ConversionTemplate`

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] For each identified Python `dspy.cache` test:
    - [ ] Document the core assertions being made.
    - [ ] Note how `Cache` instances are created and configured.
    - [ ] Identify how the `@request_cache` decorator is tested.
    - [ ] Identify any use of Python-specific features or fixtures.
- [ ] Summarize common testing patterns for `dspy.cache` features.
- [ ] List any helper functions or fixtures used in the Python tests.
- [ ] Identify challenges in translating these patterns to TypeScript/Vitest/Effect.

## Verification Steps
- The analysis document accurately reflects the structure and patterns of Python `dspy.cache` tests.
- Potential challenges for TypeScript conversion are clearly identified.

## Decision Authority
- Independent: Level of detail in the analysis.
- User Input: None.

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None anticipated.
### Non-blocking
- How to replicate Python's `cachetools` and `diskcache` behavior if direct TypeScript equivalents are not used.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Focus on patterns directly relevant to `dspy.cache`'s core responsibilities.

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This analysis will inform the creation of TypeScript test files and any necessary helper utilities for `dspy.cache`.
